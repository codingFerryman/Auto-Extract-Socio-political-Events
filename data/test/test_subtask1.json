Here are some fashionable solutions How to look good in a blanket at your desk, and other useful fashion tips 15 Aug 2015 0Comments Hong Kong malls - and offices - are often kept too cold. I am writing this as I freeze in my office, in what is supposed to be a \"green\" building. It's boiling outside, but the temperature inside has to be about 21 degrees, maybe less. I have a scarf on at my desk! I've brought it to the attention of my boss several times, but he doesn't seem bothered. Is there such a thing as a fashionable office blanket? Frozen, Central The Dictator rules: In a word, no. While I actually love a cold room, it's important to speak up. Much has been made recently of the gender bias behind low temperatures in male-dominated offices (the cold better suits the faster metabolism of men). But this issue affects not just women, it's the environment, too. Perhaps you need to embarrass your boss in order to effect change?

Dye has turned on the power in the past three weeks to draw level on 52 wins with last season's champion Whyte, who added one to his total yesterday and has yet to get fully into his stride again after a recent suspension. 'It's nice to be in with a big chance and having John Size and David Hayes supporting me is going to give me a real hope of winning,' Dye said. 'But there's not just Douglas and I in the race, either. Felix Coetzee's ridden three today and Weichong Marwing is not that far away.

To many on the inside, it is just as ugly as well. In one month, the United States House of Representatives will debate and then vote on whether to grant Permanent Normal Trading Relations (PNTR) to the mainland. If passed - a vote which then must be ratified by the Senate a week or so later - it will mean American businesses feel the market-opening benefits of the mainland's entry to the World Trade Organisation. For Beijing, PNTR will end the annual circus of the congressional review once known as Most Favoured Nation Trading Status. It is nothing short of President Bill Clinton's biggest foreign-policy initiative this year and - in his own words - the most important decision facing Capitol Hill. There any simplicity ends. Last week Dick Gephardt - Mr Clinton's most senior Democrat in the House - announced he would not back the bill. Dozens of other Democrats may follow suit to pander to other groups which could prove important in their bid to win enough votes in the November House election. Mr Gephardt and company are eyeing unions in particular to help them win in November. Mr Gephardt, of course, could end up as Speaker of the House, or another senior position, so naturally he wants to make sure as many union members as possible are mobilised. To corporate America, organised labour's opposition makes no sense, but no one is saying it is not vocal or even influential.

Within 10 days of launching a push to attract international investment under the slogan 'Slash operating costs in Hong Kong's back office', the gangland executions started again.\nTop casino inspector Francisco Xavier Pinto do Amaral and Marine Police Constable Chu Ion-kao were both killed in broad daylight and almost in the same spot, just 100 metres from the enclave's Security Forces Headquarters. There are many theories, but the chances are we may never know why they died.\nThere was an almost depressed air of resignation among the investment campaign's backers as businessmen gathered in Hong Kong and Macau this weekend to be told of the excellent cost-saving opportunities awaiting them in the Portuguese-administered territory. No one is surprised by the violence anymore.\nOn March 17, in a joint effort to transform the enclave into a 'back office' for Hong Kong-based companies, the Macau Government and Delta Asia Finance Group launched their 'Macau - a new choice for business' campaign.\nIt was to be the start of a regeneration conceived six months ago as one of the first steps to a brighter future as the enclave prepares for its return to Chinese administration on December 22, 1999.\nThe move, coupled with an international promotional push by tourism chiefs, also came in the wake of 18 months of triad violence which claimed more than a dozen lives in 1996 and 1997.\nKitty Lam Miu-fong, group marketing and communications manager for Delta Asia Finance, acknowledges they have to win the public relations battle. But she remains upbeat.\n'So far over 60 companies, many of them well-known international concerns [she refused to name them] have said they will attend our 'Relocate in Macau' seminar.

'After the play I want members of the audience to come to me with questions,' he said. Founder and executive director of one of Hong Kong's most famous experimental theatre groups, Zuni Icosahedron, Yung has been experimenting with traditional Chinese opera theatre for a decade. In recent years, he's become more interested in exploring things about the artists and not just the acts. His arts festival programme, an experimental rendition of a legendary Beijing opera script of the same name, looks at Master Cheng's life rather than the brutality of the tyrannical government of the Ming Dynasty's final years as the original story intended. The tale depicts the plight of a poor family in a village, whose harvests from the field barely make ends meet. When the government raises levies to pay for war and its own fiscal irresponsibility, the father has to track the hills to pick herbs for extra income, only to be eaten by a tiger. The son is drafted into the army and the women in the family die one after another of sheer trauma and heartbreak. Elements of the old tale will be extracted and given a new spin in Yung's play to express the theme: Crossing. '"

She limps on to the court in a leg brace, but immediately gets the ball and shoots a two-pointer. The crowd goes wild, and while Sales' teammates surround her in an orgy of celebration, they do not stop the Villanova team taking the ball back down the other end for an uncontested score.\nMeanwhile, Hunt has suddenly made a miraculous recovery on the sideline and the referees allow her to enter the game to replace Sales, who limps back off to a hero's acclaim.\nWhat's wrong with the picture? Is it sport or a game of fantasy? More to the point, is it sportsmanship?  That is the debate raging across the college basketball scene after a bizarrely orchestrated conspiracy between both teams, the referees and the league's administrators allowed the 21-year-old Sales to score her basket when by all rights she should have been at home nursing a crippled leg.\nThe above scenario, which took place in the opening 30 seconds of the game last Tuesday, was choreographed purely so the injured Sales could get the two points she needed to break the all-time scoring record for her university.

The move came after 130 congressmen wrote a letter demanding the Barack Obama administration take action to force China to raise the value of the yuan.The US Treasury has the option of declaring Beijing a currency manipulator in a report due out next month, which could set the stage for possible tariffs on Chinese goods.

The panel was set up to investigate the turbulent events which culminated in the resignation of EOC chairman Michael Wong Kin-chow  in November 2003.

But the relationship has been called into question over the past week. The decision, taken at the highest level in Beijing, to arrest the man chosen by North Korea's top leader, Kim Jong-il, to run a new special administrative region (SAR) on its border with China humiliated Mr Kim and threw the project into doubt. At dawn last Friday, about 50 police and officials swooped on the luxury villa of Yang Bin in the Holland Village estate he is building in Shenyang to question him over alleged tax evasion and other financial malpractices. Yang was appointed by Mr Kim as chief executive of the Sinuiju SAR on September 24 and received North Korean citizenship. Chinese sources said Yang had been under investigation for tax evasion since June, when the Communist Party's Propaganda Department banned the media from using his name and described him as a fraud. Beijing was unaware that Yang was negotiating with Mr Kim at the time. North Korea announced the establishment of the SAR on September 20. Beijing was angry and disappointed. Mr Kim had not told them of his plans, leaving the central government the choice of dropping its investigation against Yang, settling it quietly or proceeding as before.

Each string, each strain, evokes but vanished springs     Such feeling cannot be recalled again     It seemed long-lost even when it was felt then     From The Sad Zither by Li Shangyin (AD 813-858)     The lines quoted above sum up the sentiments of Shang Guan, about poems written during the Tang Dynasty in China. The 27-year-old, who works at a Beijing-based website management company, is a passionate reader of poetry, classical and modern.     He believes Tang poems, a 50,000-strong body of work written by around 2,200 poets between AD 618 and 907, to be a singular achievement in Chinese cultural history. They're almost too good to be true, hence they defy replication, he says.     Shang is not the only Generation-Y reader sold on the magic charm of Tang poems. Lu Li, 21, studying at the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, loves reading her favorites from the classic 300 Tang poems aloud to herself, whenever she is depressed, bored or too happy. Contemporary poetry has limited appeal for her.     \"Some writers are just expressing their own feelings, which is kind of selfish,\" she remarks. \"Whereas Tang poems are so very concerned about society and people, and not afraid to criticize the government or officials or show sympathy to poor people,\" Lu says.     Du Fu (AD 712-770), who wrote so sensitively about soldiers marching relentlessly through briers and brambles in incessant rain, gave a human twist to a tale of warfare and bravado in the poem Song of the Conscripts.     \"Conscription goes on here     The magistrates for taxes press     How can we pay them in distress!     If we had known sons bring no joy     We'd prefer a girl to a boy\"     The poem remains a favorite of Lu. She also remembers with great longing reading Du Fu's lovely poems as a child - the beginning of an enduring love affair with Tang poetry.     If Tang poetry still resonates with modern China, at least 1,200 years after these were written, there is a reason. As Du Xiaoqin, a professor of Chinese literature at Peking University and a widely-published Tang poetry expert, says: \"The Chinese situation today is close to what it was during early (AD 618-713) and high (AD 713-766) Tang periods.     \"Tang poetry was written by young people as a matter of routine, reflecting aspects of a highly prosperous society, its open-mindedness, meditation on life and na"

Leading politicians and  local and foreign insiders are weighing up the chances of another military coup, should the election not quite follow the script favoured by the ruling establishment. It is Thailand's first election since tanks rolled  onto the streets of Bangkok to oust Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in September  last year, ending his populist five-year rule. That putsch was Thailand's first military takeover in more than 15 years - the coup Thailand was never supposed to have,  following extensive efforts to remove the nation's sometimes venal generals from the political arena. This weekend the junta and its interim government are making good on promises to return Thailand  to democratic rule. Yet the constant coup talk is just one reminder that they will continue to cast a long, green shadow over Thai politics in the months and even years ahead. Samak Sundaravej,   a veteran right-winger  doing Thaksin's political bidding as head of the People's Power Party, acknowledged the coup  speculation in an interview with the South China Morning Post this week. But he said the generals knew another coup would be unacceptable and claimed  some military factions may still support the exiled telecoms billionaire. The constant coup talk is also a reminder  of Thaksin's own shadow. Until Thaksin is fully removed from the political scene, the ruling military establishment will not rest easy. Thaksin remains in exile based in Britain, where his purchase of the Manchester City Football Club has kept him in the spotlight. In Thailand, his assets are frozen and his Thai Rak Thai political machine has been barred by the courts and disbanded. He is also facing corruption charges. Thaksin has repeatedly insisted  he has no desire to return to politics, even if he  returns to Thailand. But that has not stopped the emergence of the PPP as a political proxy that has become home to 270 former Thai Rak Thai MPs not barred by the courts. 'Thaksin is a good man, he was good for the country,' Mr Samak has been telling cheering crowds across the country, tapping into the still-widespread  support for a leader who lavished funds on the poor through loans to villagers and dirt-cheap health care. At the height of his powers (he was the first prime minister to lead his party into a second term without a coalition) Thaks"

Absolutely nothing, at least in terms of money.\nEvery team in the World Cup will get US$658,000 from FIFA for every match they play. That translates into about US$2 million for the three first-round games that everyone plays.\nThe World Cup winners and runners-up will each get US$4.6 million because they both play seven matches. There is no bonus for the team who win the Cup.\nWhen a team qualify for the World Cup, their national federation gets US$493,000 to help with preparation costs.\nFIFA also helps out with the hotel costs and the daily allowance for the national delegations of up to 45 people. They get US$247 a day per person. So while in money terms both finalists are equal at the World Cup, there is no accounting for the prestige of being crowned world champions.

How can a shop specialising in toy soldiers, with a name harking back to colonialism, survive in a modern Chinese city? The answer, paradoxically, is that this nostalgia shop has marched with the times.\nOwner and sole toy designer Andy Nielson has transformed the shop from dealing exclusively in toy soldiers to specialising in models of Hong Kong street scenes such as rickshaw pullers, street-side schools, labourers, and even a Governor.\nIn the process, his customers have broadened from being exclusively European males to an equal mixture of Europeans and Asians with a healthy representation of women.\n'People are surprised [at our success] and one of the things they tend to ask is how we can make money out of this,' Mr Nielson said. He gapes in disbelief at the question. 'I've been in Pacific Place for seven years. Do people honestly think they would keep us there if we didn't make money?'  Turnover is $15 million a year, about two-thirds of which comes from overseas orders, particularly the United States where the Hong Kong street scenes are popular. It is a healthy sum considering the change in focus.\nThe original idea of starting King & Country came more by accident than design. The shop was set up in 1984 after Mr Nielson's brother sent him toy soldiers for his birthday and he lamented that he could not buy them in Hong Kong. His ex-wife, Laura McAllister, pointed out he was in the toy capital in the world. Why not set up his own shop?  'I wasn't a toy soldier collector - I'd only collected them when I was a kid - but my two interests are the military and art,' Mr Nielson said. So he jumped at the idea.\nHe tracked down the last company in Hong Kong that was making hand-painted, metal toy soldiers and started designing his mod"

  "text": "Time for a summary after a raft of manufacturing reports from around the world. In the US, the Markit PMI was revised higher but the Institute for Supply Management‚Äôs (ISM) index of US factory activity suggested growth almost ground to a standstill last month. Employment in the sector fell, according to the ISM survey, prompting some expectations of a gloomy picture when the closely watched non-farm payrolls report on the US labour market is published on Friday. With markets seizing on downbeat news as positive for shares, because it is seen cutting the chances of a US rate hike in December, Wall Street extended gains after the manufacturing report. October was a mixed month overall for global manufacturing. China‚Äôs malaise continued, with activity shrinking for the eighth month in a row. Economists say it means Beijing may need to cut interest rates again soon, to prop up demand. The UK smashed forecasts, with growth hitting its fastest rate in 16 months. Some analysts couldn‚Äôt quite believe the numbers, and argued that the underlying picture was less healthy. The Eurozone had a rather subdued month - with growth in Germany and Spain slowing, and French factories posting little growth. Italy did surprisingly well, though. Over in Athens, Greek bank shares jumped after stress tests showed they ‚Äúonly‚Äù need ‚Ç¨14.4bn in new capital.... ...while students are protesting about education cuts. Britain‚Äôs biggest bank, HSBC, noted a reduction in income from overdraft fees as it reported a rise in profits but drop in revenues. The bank also warned it may delay until next a year its decision on whether to remain based in London. In other banking news, the UK‚Äôs high street banks are each in line for multimillion-pound windfalls from the sale of Visa Europe in a deal valuing the credit and debit card company at ‚Ç¨21.2bn (¬£15bn) And the Turkish stock market and lira have both jumped after Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan‚Äôs party won last night‚Äôs general election. Investors welcomed the decisive result, even though it may lead to more discontent among opposition supporters. On that note, we‚Äôll close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we‚Äôll be back again tomorrow. President Barack Obama has highlighted his hope that the US will be spared eleventh-hour government shutdown threats as he signed a new budget bill today. By signing into law the pact agreed last week by Congress, Obama also averts the threat of a default on US government debt. The US Congress reached the two-year budget agreement in a rare bipartisan breakthrough. The pact takes volatile issues like the debt limit and government funding off the table until after the 2016 presidential election, thus paving the way for soon-to-be speaker of the House Paul Ryan to ease into his new role as John Boehner resigns from Congress. Reuters reports that in a brief signing ceremony in the Oval Office, Obama noted lawmakers would still need to pass spending bills, but said he was confident they could get them done on time, and that the bill should free the nation from last-minute government shutdown threats. European markets have now closed and most main indices have got off to a solid start to November. Only London‚Äôs FTSE 100 is left behind, flat at 6,362 after gains for banking stocks were offset by weaker miners in the wake of more downbeat manufacturing data out of China. Here‚Äôs how the main indices finished the day: In the US, stock markets are also higher. Sticking with financial services, the UK‚Äôs high street banks are each in line for multimillion-pound windfalls from the sale of Visa Europe in a deal valuing the credit and debit card company at ‚Ç¨21.2bn (¬£15bn). Owned by thousands of lenders, Visa Europe is being sold to its one-time sister company, Visa Inc, which was floated on the US stock market in 2008. The UK‚Äôs main banks could receive up to ¬£1bn between them, reports Jill Treanor. She writes: The deal sparked a flurry of stock market announcements from the lenders that had to reveal their profits. Barclays expects to make ¬£400m and bailed-out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland ¬£300m and ¬£200m respectively. HSBC‚Äôs profit was estimated at ¬£150m. Chirantan Barua, analyst at Bernstein Research, warned the benefits might not be long-standing: ‚ÄúAlthough we see this as a positive in the short term for the UK banks as this represents a boost to capital we do not see this as a free lunch. Now that the banks will be ‚Äòexternal‚Äô to the payment system they will see their fee income margin start to be squeezed and we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Visa tried to increase the margins in Europe at the expense of the banks.‚Äù Worldpay, the payments company recently floated on the London Stock Exchange, said it expected to receive ‚Ç¨1.2bn. There are more than 500m Visa cards issued across Europe and the deal is being announced ‚Äì after years of speculation ‚Äì at a time when new regulations will cap fees that banks can charge retailers for debit and credit card use. A rise in the use of cards is also expected in the years ahead and this would allow Visa to compete more effectively with Mastercard. The full news story: Elsewhere in the banking sector, Barclays has agreed to pay out $94m to settle US antitrust lititgation by investors, Reuters reports. According to the news service, the UK-listed bank was among 11 banks accused by investors of conspiring to manipulate the benchmark European Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) and related derivatives. Barclays is the first defendant to settle, according to court papers. Reuters continues: Kenneth Feinberg, a prominent mediator who helped broker the accord, said in an affidavit ‚Äúthis first and early settlement with Barclays provides plaintiffs with a precedent and settlement structure that may encourage other interested defendants to settle.‚Äù Barclays‚Äô preliminary settlement requires court approval. Other defendants include BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc, Credit Agricole SA, Deutsche Bank AG , HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co , Rabobank BA, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Societe Generale SA and UBS AG. The electronic broker-dealer ICAP Plc is also a defendant. The full story is here. HSBC caused a political storm in April when it announced it was considering whether to keep its headquarters in London. Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive, has previously said the decision would be known by the end of 2015 but now it seems the wait may be longer. My colleague Jill Treanor has been reporting on the bank‚Äôs results today and HSBC‚Äôs comments that it may delay a decision on whether to remain based in London until next year. Here is a flavour of Jill‚Äôs updated story following HSBC‚Äôs delayed conference call. As the bank announced results for the first nine months of the year, it said a decision might take longer. ‚ÄúAn announcement will be made when the board makes its final decision and, if necessary, a further update will be provided at the time of the full year results,‚Äù the bank said. Douglas Flint, the HSBC chairman, said the board had requested additional information as part of the review. He said the decision would be based ‚Äúon long-term perspectives rather than short-term factors‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe take it very seriously and give it the appropriate amount of work,‚Äù said Flint, who was speaking from China, where the bank had just sealed a deal to create a securities trading venture in Shenzhen. ‚ÄúWe are halfway through.‚Äù The bank has been linked with a series of alternative locations in addition to Hong Kong, including the US and Canada. Since HSBC announced its review, the British government has made changes to the taxation of banks that are regarded as preferable to HSBC. It has also clarified parts of the regulatory regime that had been concerning the bank. Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, said: ‚ÄúWe think that HSBC should move ahead with a re-domicile out of the UK as soon as possible.‚Äù Despite the reduction in the bank levy announced by George Osborne in July, Gordon said HSBC was still expecting to pay $1.6bn (¬£1bn) towards the levy, which is based on the size of bank balance sheets in 2017. The full story: Shares in HSBC are down almost 1%, or 4.3p, at 503.1p. They are down 17% from the start of the year. On Wall Street, traders appear to have latched onto to the downbeat tone of the latest manufacturing report, which pointed to a drop in employment last month. US non-farm payrolls numbers due on Friday will be all important to how the Federal Reserve judges the state of the labour market but in the meantime, this week reading from an admittedly small sector of the US economy is seen as reducing the chances of a December rate hike. The Dow Jones industrial average has extended earlier gains to be up around 100 points at 17,764. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 36 points at 5,090. The S&amp;P 500 is up 10 points at 2,089, having been flat at the open before the manufacturing reports. In the UK, where a manufacturing report earlier signalled a rebound in output and orders, the FTSE 100 down, but only by one point, at 6360. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spread-betting firm Spreadex has been following US reactions: It appears that investors took the negative news to heart, lifting the Dow Jones to near 3-month highs as November‚Äôs first piece of crucial information (in what is going to be a month full of over-scrutinised data) arguably dealt a blow to the Fed‚Äôs hopes of raising rates in December. The fervour around US news is only going to increase in importance as the week goes on, with factory orders, Markit and ISM services PMIs, a testimony from Janet Yellen and, of course, Friday‚Äôs non-farm jobs report still to come. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) highlights various headwinds in its report showing a slowdown in US manufacturing growth in October. Comments from the panel reflect concern over the high price of the dollar and the continuing low price of oil, mixed with cautious optimism about steady to increasing demand in several industries.‚Äù Reacting to the report, which just beat expectations but showed barely any growth last month, James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets says there are possible implications for the closely watched US non-farm payrolls report due on Friday: The details are very mixed. Both new orders and production improved to stand at 52.9, but employment fell to 47.6 from 50.5. By falling into contraction territory (sub-50) this suggests some downside risk for Friday‚Äôs jobs number, although manufacturing is dwarfed by the service sector in terms of overall employment and a stronger non-ISM figure would raise optimism once again. It is clear that the manufacturing sector is going to continue to underperform non-manufacturing given that dollar strength and external demand weakness are clear drags for the sector. However, we are more hopeful for the service sector while construction "

Mother, father, son, daughter, uncle and aunt of all football matches would be nearer the mark.\nIran's intoxicating 2-1 win over America was one of the World Cup matches that will remain etched on the memories of all those who witnessed it for years.\nTechnically, it was not pretty. But it was never going to be one for the purists.\nPasses went astray regularly and both sides at times displayed a naivete in defence which suggests they will do well to avoid defeats against their remaining opponents Germany and Yugoslavia on Thursday.\nBut what this encounter lacked in footballing aesthetics was counter-balanced by both teams' white-hot level of commitment, which shone through from the outset.\nThe early exchanges were frenetic. The furious din being raised in the stands appeared to distract the Iranian players, who did well to withstand wave after wave of American attacks.\nBarely five minutes had gone before Brian McBride rattled the woodwork, his firm header thumping off the bar after a wicked outswinging free-kick by Claudio Reyna.\nKhodadad Azizi, whose scorching pace frightened the American defence all night, was at the heart of the game's first major flashpoint two minutes later when he toe-poked the ball under advancing American goalkee"

The stories, connected ingeniously, vary greatly in tone and quality. The first two display so little of the author‚Äôs narrative skill that they may offer more temptation to stop reading than to go on. Liking the last part of the book much better, I could wish that it stood alone. In Martel‚Äôs Booker-winning Life of Pi, the author within the story tells us that he went to India with the intention of writing a novel set in Portugal. Then he met the Indian who told him the tale of Pi, and Portugal was forgotten. It‚Äôs recollected in the first part of this book in great detail: ‚ÄúHe heads off down Rua S√£o Miguel on to Largo S√£o Miguel and then Rua de S√£o Jo√£o da Pra√ßa before turning on to Arco de Jesus.‚Äù This sort of street-rosary may delight Lisbon initiates but to others is made interesting only by the fact that the protagonist, Tomas, is walking backwards, and that he always does so. After some elaborate rationales for walking backwards, and a farcical encounter with a lamp post, we learn that he walks with ‚Äúhis back to the world, his back to God‚Äù, not because he is grieving for the sudden, recent death of his wife, his child and his father, but because ‚Äúhe is objecting‚Äù.

Until 1986, her blood was cleaned by litres of dextrose solution, bled into her body through a long plastic tube inserted in her abdomen. Later, an inflammation of her abdomen prevented her from carrying out the procedure in the comfort of her own home.\nNow Ms Choi goes to Princess Margaret Hospital twice a week for the treatment. She also needs regular injections to sustain the number of red blood cells in her body. Often, muscle cramps and vomiting make her feel even worse. Her fragile health is such that work has been made impossible.\nA turning point will only come when a new kidney is available for transplant. The prospect of that happening, however, is grim, given the cool response to ongoing campaigns appealing for organ donation.\nHence, a family and a regular job with a stable income are but distant dreams for people like Ms Choi (kidney patients, though, can consider themselves luckier, considering the fate that awaits patients in need of a liver or heart transplant).\nMedical experts such as transplant surgeon Professor Fan Sheung-tat at Queen Mary Hospital warn that nearly half of the patients who desperately need a new liver and a third requiring heart transplants will die waiting, due to the grave shortage of donors.\nThere are 900 on the kidney transplant list, 100 waiting for a new liver and 20 for a heart or lungs.\nLowering her head, Ms Choi took out a newspaper clipping from her bulging handbag on the recent suicide of a married renal patient whom she had befriended.\nThe 47-year-old man with two children had also been stricken with kidney problems for more than a decade, but his situation worsened so that he could not walk and was wheelchair-bound. He took his life, wrapping his body with wires connected to an electric circuit.\n'I can understand why he did it,' Ms Choi says. 'The pressure must have been unbearable to him. He was the kind of person who liked to keep things to himself. Life would be much easier for people like us if only transplants were available.'  F"

But the children can avoid this fate, says a nutrition professor, if mothers increase their intake of an omega-3 fatty acid simply known as DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), a nutrient primarily found in fish. Dr Susan Carlson, a professor based at the University of Kansas Medical Centre who has researched the nutrient for about 30 years, was in Hong Kong recently to present her latest findings from an ongoing six-year study on the benefits of DHA during pregnancy. She says consuming DHA supplements results in an \"overall longer gestation period as well as greater infant size\". \"This appears to be due to a significant reduction in early pre-term and very low birth weight infants, which was an important outcome of the study.\" The World Health Organisation says health risks, including a longer period of hospitalisation after birth, are higher among babies delivered weighing less than 2.5kg. Carlson was invited to Hong Kong by DSM, the nutritional products maker that provided the supplement capsules in Carlson's study. DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid (or \"good\" fat) that is found in fatty tissues in the brain and retina. It is also found in varying amounts in human breast milk, fish oils and marine algae. The body can convert alpha-linolenic acid from plant oils, and breast and formula milk into the nutrient. DHA is essential for infant brain, eye and nervous system development. It is particularly important in the third trimester of pregnancy, when significant brain growth occurs. Very premature infants may be deficient in DHA because they miss out on this period in utero when the fatty acid accumulates in tissue. Yet, the findings are hotly debated. \"I would say that it's pretty controversial,\" Carlson admits, saying researchers have conducted three reviews of available studies and found that DHA did not benefit infants' cognitive development. Still, since 2001, Carlson's studies with colleague and neuroscientist John Colombo have influenced infant formula makers to begin adding DHA using marine oil extracts. However, Melissa Liu, with the risk assessment section of Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety, notes there is insufficient evidence to confirm the benefits of DHA in infants and children. \"As such, the European Union only accepts claims mentioning that DHA intake contributes to t"

In Asia, which has benefited from the global liquidity resulting from the Fed's policy, there are fears that various asset bubbles may be about to burst in a repeat of the regional financial crisis of 1997. However, there is no evidence that we are heading for another crash should the Fed stop its programme of buying US$85 billion worth of Treasuries and mortgage bonds every month to keep long-term interest rates low and encourage lending. One of the best ways to illustrate this is to look at whether capital flows into Asia from foreign investors have been out of the ordinary. Looking at data going back to 1975 on cross-border capital movements in the shape of foreign direct investment, portfolio flows and loans, the pace of foreign investment under quantitative easing has not been that different from before the global financial crisis. Specifically, Asia's foreign liabilities increased at a steady pace "

Photo: AP The prickly relationship between Australia and Indonesia, based on different interpretations of history, has once again found its way into the public spotlight. What sets this latest fracas apart most is its setting ‚Äì military circles. Reportedly, teaching materials used to train Indonesian soldiers at Campbell Barracks in Perth, Western Australia, offered sympathy for West Papuan independence, covered the topic of Indonesian war crimes in East Timor, and mocked the nation‚Äôs founding principles as ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù. In reaction, Indonesia announced a full suspension of defence cooperation with Australia on Wednesday, only to have former general and senior Cabinet minister Wiranto tell reporters the next day in Jakarta that the suspension only applies to a language programme. For its part, the Australian government announced an investigation into the incident and underscored its stance on the general strength of ties between the two nations. This Week in Asia contacted the Campbell Barracks on Thursday and later spoke to a defence department spokesperson in Western Australia who could offer no comment, and referred the matter to the capital, Canberra. Still, the flare up is yet another reminder about the fragility of the friendship between the two nations. The story gained traction at the highest levels in Indonesia after news outlet Kompas reported on a cable sent by General Gatot Nurmantyo instructing all defence cooperation with Australia be suspended. Indonesia denies halting all military cooperation with A"

Both have spent many years abroad. They have a familiar love-hate relationship with the Material City, passionately attached and yet impatient. Hong Kong lacks balance, they agreed. The city is all obsessive work ethic and no play. A recent survey by charity Community Business  and the University of Hong Kong  bears out this  image, with an average working week of 55 hours and 80 per cent of employees working unpaid overtime. We finished our meal and drove to Sha Tin to attend a joyful, uninhibited production of Nikolai Gogol's The Overcoat by Theatre du Pif, a multilingual repertory troupe. The earlier conversation seemed at odds with the play and its setting, Sha Tin's hideously designed but warmly communal town hall. In a few minutes, we went from the formal elegance of Central, to experimental theatre in Sha Tin, with its family ambience and streets scented with anise. What more persuasive example could there be of the range of Hong Kong as a city?

While the schools were allegedly motivated by wanting to guarantee attendance, some kids felt sick after taking the drug.A parent surnamed Zhang from Xi'an of Shaanxi felt very puzzled. \"So many unexpected things have happened to our kids, like tainted milk, avoidable school bus crashes and child abuse. We do not know who can be trusted.\"The cases Zhang mentioned have set alarm bells ringing in China and ushered in reforms in certain areas.The reputation of Chinese dairy products was seriously undermined by a scandal in 2008, when unscrupulous Chinese milk producers were found to have mixed melamine with their products to cheat protein content tests.The incident led to the deaths of at least six Chinese babies and left another 300,000 ill.

Liu defeated six other contestants in the first two rounds of text message votes and beat 7-year-old runner-up, the stand-up comedian Zhang Fengxi, in the last round of voting.He could not hold back his tears when he was awarded the crown. When asked why he was crying, his words took most people by surprise.    \"Shou Junchao (his rap singing fellow contestant) and I are actually very close friends behind the scenes. Though we are on the same stage I'm not pleased at having beaten him,\" Liu said.    Liu will be invited to perform on Taiwan singer Jolin Tsai's world tour and will also have a three-month stint at Las Vegas. He is also likely to get a contract with Fremantle Media and Sony Music Entertainment.    Nevertheless, Liu seemed quite calm during his TV interview after the show wrapped up.

It would probably be the only chance for I Corrupt All Cops to pick up a statuette,  as the picture is less a hard-hitting look at police corruption in the wild and woolly 1960s and 70s than a tawdry expose full of drugs, sex, and violence. First and foremost, the movie is pure Wong Jing.  The director-writer (and in this case, co-star) has brought us a 2009 version of the kind of film that helped define mainstream Hong Kong cinema's heyday in the 1980s and early 90s. It's a reminder of the kind of local production rarely made nowadays and, for a good part of its overlong 110 minutes, manages to hold a viewer's attention in a guilty-pleasure type of way. The sprawling narrative - better suited to a miniseries format - follows a number of interconnecting strands, none of which are devel"

The board of directors of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing yesterday approved the change, which will become effective after receiving approval from the Securities and Futures Commission.

'Do not worry, there is no genetically modified (GM) material in our products. Look at the label certifying it,' she said. 'Last month, with all the stories in the media about GM food, we had a drop in sales because people were worried about it. Since we put the labels on from the end of March, sales have picked up again.' The label is the result of a regulation by the Ministry of Agriculture which took effect on March 20, ordering food that contained GM ingredients to be labelled to let consumers know the contents. Mrs Wang's company, Dou Dou Chu (the Soya Bean Kitchen), labels its products not because they contain GM beans but because China has since 1996 imported millions of tonnes of GM soya beans - which makes consumers think its juice might be made from them. The debate over the safety and nutritional value of GM products has started in earnest on the mainland, later than in the US, Europe, Japan and Hong Kong. The scientific community is strongly in favour, eager to raise the output of food in a country that had shortages and rationing as recently as 20 years ago. The general public remains sceptical. On the outcome of this debate hangs a market potential of hundreds of millions of dollars for domestic and foreign producers. 'GM products are bad for you,' Mrs Wang said. 'They are like mad cow disease and damage your health.' The label on Mrs Wang's juice reads: 'This product is made of carefully chosen black soya bean that is not"

The buyer could rent the same flat for $30,000-$35,000 per month in the depressed market.\nAs well as this differential between the cost of renting and buying, purchasers face other compelling reasons for staying out of the market.\nThese include high interest rates, increasing levels of unemployment, slower than expected economic growth and an increasingly conservative banking sector which virtually has turned off the taps on lending.\nA.G. Wilkinson & Associates assistant director Michael McGuire said this cocktail of negative factors had dampened buying sentiment - which arguably is one of the strongest factors affecting prices and buying activity in the SAR.\nEqually devastating to the market is that for the first time many middle-class buyers have been left in a position of negative equity.\nMany owners of flats purchased last year had seen the value of their asset depreciate subs"

As corporate entities were wholly or partly responsible for electing 570 out of the Election Committee's 1,200 seats in 2011, and 20 out of 35 Legislative Council functional constituency seats in 2012, their influence rivals that of human voters.

He offers pujas, or prayers, to those who, like him, fled to India after the People‚Äôs Liberation Army crushed protesters in Lhasa. The crackdown ended a fledgling rebellion against Chinese rule and sent the Dalai Lama into exile. Thousands of Tibetans surrounded the Dalai Lama‚Äôs palace in Lhasa 60 years ago on Sunday, fearing a Chinese plot to kidnap or assassinate the leader. Chinese forces had occupied the Himalayan region nine years earlier and formed an uneasy alliance with the Dalai Lama, but tensions had been building. By 17 March 1959 Chinese artillery was aimed at the palace, and a few days later troops opened fire, killing thousands. By the end of the month, China had dissolved the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama had escaped, smuggled out of the city disguised as a Chinese soldier. For Atti, 87, who was among those fighting against Chinese rule, the anniversary brings a mix of emotions, chief among them anger and sadness. ‚ÄúTibet was completely taken over by China and many people died,‚Äù he says. Hundreds of supporters of the 14th Dalai Lama surrounded his temple in Dharamsala in India on Sunday, home to his government in exile since 1959. Supporters elsewhere planned marches to commemorate the failed uprising and call attention to what they describe as a brutal campaign of suppression. Chinese authorities have tightened their hold on Tibet, which Beijing claims has always been part of China. Local officials have instituted a ‚Äúgrid‚Äù system of security through a vast network of ‚Äúconvenient police stations‚Äù, checkpoints and the use of mass surveillance. Tibetans often cannot travel freely in and out of the region and their communication is often mo"

The Vice-President happily turned on the charm - a quality noticeably absent from his political arsenal until three weeks ago - before a mostly female audience. He buttered up America's most-watched talk-show host, comparing his own struggles with the more famous career battles of Oprah and turning every question into a gentle nudge towards his campaign pledges to help families help themselves.

Maria Cheng reports Are doctors over-treating breast cancer? At a breast cancer conference last week in Barcelona, experts discussed how to implement mammogram screening programs across Europe, balancing fighting cancer with the goal of targeting only those women who need to be screened. For years, officials have promoted breast cancer screening as the best way to spot the disease and save lives. Yet mammograms are far from perfect and come with an unwelcome side effect: false alarms and unneeded biopsies, without substantially improving women's odds of survival. The mammogram issue ignited a fierce debate in the United States last year when an influential government panel recommended scaling back screening programs to begin at age 50 instead of 40 - guidelines close to many in Europe. In most women, tumors are slow growing, and that likelihood increases with age. So there is little risk by extending the time between mammograms, some researchers say. Even for the minority of women with aggressive tumors, annual screening seems to make little difference i"

Sitting in the hotel lounge, there is no doubting the four elegant-looking people are a veritable spice arsenal.\nRebecca Wu Ing Ing, Tsin Ting, Lau Yun and Billie Tam are probably names that would draw blank stares from star-struck teenagers obsessed with the likes of Canto-pop singers such as Kelly Chan Wai-lum or Gigi Leung Wing-kei. But for their parents - and perhaps even some grandparents - these are names that bring back fond memories of the good old days when 'songs were songs and not the cacophony of noise it is today', according to one old-timer.\nBetween them, these four voices held millions enthralled with their huangmeidiao and Mandarin pop songs, and probably accounted for a good part of most of the biggest Chinese hits spanning the 1940s to the 1970s. Hong Kong will have the chance again to hear these voices from the past when they hold their joint concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum from March 6 to 9.\nThat the four have managed to get together for the shows is in itself quite a feat. Separated by continents - Tsin and Lau live in Hong Kong, while Wu's home is in Los Angeles and Tam's is in Vancouver - the four singers have only kept in touch occasionally with the centre of contact being Tsin.\n'[Show] promoters usually look for me and then I contact the others,' said Tsin, who has regular sold-out solo shows in the SAR.\nThis is the second year Tsin has helped co-ordinate such a concert. Last year, she was joined by Wu, Lau and another singer, Chui Ping, for a similar show. This time, however, she has scored a bit of a coup by persuading Tam to come out of a 22-year retirement.\n'I said yes because she is a long-time friend,' said 55-year-old Tam who retired in 1976 to spend time with her husband and raise her son. 'At the time I also felt that this is the time to do what I want to do.'  Not having sung for more than two decades, Tam has been frantically dragging out old records to practise again.\nDespite the slow economy having hit the concert industry hard - Canto-pop singers have been cutting down on planned concerts - the singers and show promoters, Asia Vigour, are confident enough to have a four-sided stage this time instead of last y"

Otherwise you may find that you have not bid adieu to your, er, deposits, but merely au revoir. You'll be leaning over the railing of the junk when certain objects will float by, saying, 'Hello, remember me?'  It is becoming clear that the sewage scheme that was going to rescue Victoria Harbour (which should more accurately be called Victoria Toilet) has stalled.\nYou remember how Hong Kong's two most environmentally friendly governors, Sir David Wilson and Chris Patten, enthused endlessly about the 'Strategic Sewage Disposal Scheme'. (How does one know whether one has emitted a piece of Strategic Sewage or a non-strategic one? This question has never been satisfactorily answered.)  Today, the new sewage system, like democracy, has been given an unspecified arrival date sometime in the next millennium.\nWhile we wait, let us examine the fascinating history of that distasteful but important item of everyday life which doctors call 'poop'.\nA copralite, as you know, is a fossiled piece of dinosaur poop. Paleontologists treat them with the worshipful adoration a Hong Kong tai-tai lavishes on her gold toothpick collection. There have been no significant copralite discoveries in Hong Kong, suggesting that natural recycling was working well for the first few 100 million years.\nThe first fisherfolk inhabitants of Hong Kong used the same toilet we do: the harbour.\nBut they dispensed with the middlemen. They would simply position their bottoms over the edge of the boat.\nForeign sailors used much the same system, except they were rather more shy.\nThere was an enclosed little room (called a jardine - I have no idea why) at the end of each ship with a hole in the floor.\nThe first flushing "

PUBLISHED : Sunday, 15 April, 2007, 12:00am Experts see similarities to 1980s Japan Filmgoers lucky enough to have scored tickets to the full-house premiere of Bubble Fiction: Boom or Bust at the Hong Kong International Film Festival last month may have enjoyed more than the standard Japanese time-travel comedy. According to some leading economists, they were treated to a cautionary tale about where China might be headed. Baba Yasuo's comedy details the efforts of a  young Japanese bar hostess who travels back to 1990 in an effort to save both her mother (trapped in a time-machine related mishap, naturally) and the country's economy, which is about to sink into a decade of stagnation. In the process, it recounts with a little historical licence how the booming Japanese economy of the late 1980s gave way to the prolonged downturn the following decade. From former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers to banking giant Goldman Sachs to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (Cass), economists have recently been taking a second look at Japan's experiences nearly two decades ago for clues on what could happen to the mainland if its own boom turns to bust. For investors rushing to get piece of the action in the surging mainland, the similarities between the two bull runs offer a sobering note of caution, hinting at the potential of grave losses in China plays. On the other hand, as some of the same economists note, the differences between the two markets are probably substantial enough to prevent the kind of collapse that turned high-fliers into dead ducks. The parallels between Japan then and China today start with twin bubbles in the stock market and real estate. In seven years during the 1980s, the Nikkei 225 index more than quadrupled. At the same time, in Japan's six largest cities, the price of land more than tripled. Meanwhile, a sky-rocketing trade surplus led to calls from the United States and other large trading partners for a rapid increase in the yen's value - a debate ominously reminiscent of today's wrangling over the yuan.  Easy credit led to the same concerns that now surround the mainland's banking system. By early 1990, the good times came to an end in Japan. Within two years, the Nikkei dropped by half, and it still has not c"

They could exchange vows either at one of the five government marriage registries in Hong Kong or at a licensed place of worship. But thanks to a relaxation in Hong Kong's marriage law, couples now have the freedom to choose when and where to enjoy their special day. An amendment to the Marriage Ordinance allows marriages officiated by appointed civil celebrants - solicitors with seven years of post-qualification experience and notaries - to take place at the time and place of the couple's choosing. For couples, this means more convenience, more choice and even more creativity when planning their solemnisation ceremony. On April 23 Hongkongers Yan Wing-fai and Chan Ye-ha became the first couple to take advantage of the new law. Their prized pet shih tzu was in attendance, a luxury that would not be allowed at a government registry. They were also able to marry on what they deemed to be a lucky day. Hong Kong Marriage Ceremony Services (HKMCS), one of the first private registries to enter the market following the announcement of the bill last November, had organised the proceedings at one of their eight ceremony halls. Managing director Alfred Siu said there were myriad advantages to conducting a ceremony at a venue of one's choice. First, venue bookings can be made far in advance, unlike at a government registry where couples are constrained by the 31\/2-month maximum time period between the expiration of the notice of ma"

Now his bulging muscles and button-sized calluses attract only quizzical looks.\nNevertheless, at a cafe at the Holiday Inn Golden Mile, where he slinks in wearing an imitation snake-skin suit and a bulky jade-and-gold necklace, sidelong glances from guests lift his spirits. 'Martial arts made me a star,' he declares.\nWhile it is obvious Wong is still in shape, the protege of director Huang Feng has been lying low in the entertainment world for the past few years.\nBut he has not been idle. Instead of making movies, he now promotes Muay Thai (Thai boxing) and kickboxing on the mainland, and manufactures and markets his 'Carter Wong Kung Fu Balm', which promises to relieve not only muscular pain but also headaches, stomach aches and travel sickness.

But probably all this means is that he is in his own universe - one with no room for discord.\n'My friends say I come from Mars because I can see the whole planet from the outside,' he jokes, describing the 72-hectare mountain property in Boulder, Colorado, where he lives and works.\nThree thousand metres above sea level and cut off from civilisation in winter, it is the closest he gets to nirvana, at least when he is not making music.\nWhich probably explains why the Japanese-born artist is so prolific. In his latest offering, Gaia - Onbashira, Kitaro treads familiar ground, by mixing the sounds of nature with his trusty synthesiser and orchestra of 'exotic' instruments, including the biwa (Japanese lute), tamboura and tabla. The album is a tribute to Gaia (Mother Earth) and Onbashira, the Shinto 'Festival of Pillars' held every seven years in Nagano Prefecture, his second home and site of the last Winter Olympics.\nJust as well the festival is not an annual event because 'every time, a few people die', says Kitaro.\nTo keep alive a 1,200-year-old ritual of replacing the four sacred posts at the Suwa Shrine in Nagano, otherwise normal men fell gigantic fir trees on a mountaintop and ride the trunks down perilously steep slopes.\nThese are then lugged into town and prayers conducted to bond with and appease the gods.\nIn Gaia, Kitaro supposedly taps into the psychic energy enveloping the event. But what he probably picks up are the vibrations of fear, which appear ominously in the title track, the third of six in the 50-minute-long recording.\nBorn Masanori Takahashi to a Buddhist farming family in Japan, Kitaro is careful to remain down-to-earth despite frequent references to his own form of 'astral travel'.\n'At some point [in my life] I saw something inside my image; I could go out of space; I watched the Earth from the outside; That was a new experience.'  Weird? Probably not for the Japanese, who delight in the obscure. A facet of Japan's indigenous religion of Shinto is poetry, whereby divinities themselves are said to"

It happened in the first direct elections in 1991, again in 1995, and it will happen once more on May 24.\nWhen party vice-chairman Dr Anthony Cheung Bing-leung told the Chinese-language press there was a real prospect of securing 16 seats this time, chairman Martin Lee Chu-ming angrily retorted that there was no chance of winning anything like as many. Mr Lee and other senior party figures have repeatedly suggested that the Democrats can only hope to take 10 directly elected seats at most, and perhaps a couple of the functional constituencies.\nIt's not that Dr Cheung's prediction was necessarily wrong, although it is probably a more accurate estimate of the likely total strength of the democratic camp in the new legislature, rather than simply that of the Democratic Party. Instead, his real crime was that he broke the first rule of the party's election strategy, which is always to vastly underestimate the number of seats they expect to win.\nSuch efforts to deflate expectations serve several purposes.

University of Hong Kong real estate and construction department associate professor Lawrence Lai Wai-chung believes the answer is simple.\n'Everything has a substitute,' Mr Lai said, so the large number of government-subsidised units about to come on stream could offer a real alternative to the more expensive private flats.\nIn the past two decades, developers, to a certain extent, have been able to regulate market movements through private flat supply.\nThis control has been eroded and the powerful cards are held by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, analysts said.\nThey point out that any cut in the supply of subsidised housing made it easier for developers to control the real estate market.\nThe Government's plan to control the property sector through a large supply of government-subsidised housing for sale was officially announced in October.\nThe announcement came shortly after Mr Tung returned from Singapore, where th"

In the past couple of years, performance-art style actions ‚Äì often cheeky or humorous, always eye-catching ‚Äì have raised awareness of the challenges facing women in China. Twenty-somethings staged Occupy the Men's Toilets to challenge the lack of female facilities, shaved their heads to highlight higher college admission requirements for female applicants, and donned wedding dresses daubed with red to focus attention on domestic violence. The truth about the Guangzhou incident is even more curious. Those involved in the previous events say the women in body paint were nothing to do with them, and are convinced it was a viral marketing stunt for a soft drinks brand. Though some are perturbed by the commercial hijacking of their message, at least a couple are oddly cheered by it. \"It shows our activities have had an impact,\" said Xiao Men, who, like the others, uses a nickname. While there are not many feminists in China, feminism is neither new nor imported.

But that would be offset by domestic spending to stimulate growth.\nHe said capital markets would come back in the near term.\n'Although people are still cautious, interest is certainly there. Infrastructure provides the most attractive area of investment and has the strongest growth potential.\n'Given the strong flow into mutual funds - and there have not been a lot of redemptions - and the falling treasury rate in the US, emerging market investors are still looking for investments in Asia.'  Societe Generale Asia managing director Ashley Wilkins agreed.\n'There has been growing interest in capital market financing,' he said. 'That will slow down in Asia because of the current economic turbulence. But China is one of the very few countries which may currently remain on the radar.'  The Asian financial woes would lead banks to pay greater attention to - and find ways to minimise - currency risks, Mr Wilkins said.\nIn the mainland, foreign-exchange risk was now largely controlled through indexing repayment to US dollars, he said.\nDespite Beijing's insistence it will not devalue the yuan, foreign investors such as New World Infrastructure and GZI Transport are gauging the possibility of raising yuan lending to fund their infrastructure projects to reduce foreign-exchange risks.\nBankers said that made sense, although it thwarted Beijing's main purpose of bringing in foreign investors to enlarge its pool of capital.\n'I don't think it's going to be the major trend,' Mr Zhang said"

European Union statistics suggest children's toys account for 20 per cent of the mainland's annual exports to the continent,  while the rag trade is the biggest export sector to Europe. There are also 20 billion clothes exported from the mainland to the EU a year alone, without taking into account the copies of high fashion brands such as Dolce & Gabbana. Just how this economic whirlwind is blowing into Europe from the East this Christmas is best seen in places  such as the Poligono Cobo Calleja in Spain. This unglamorous, slate-grey industrial estate, about  25km from Madrid, is the biggest distribution centre for mainland goods in Europe. Here, about 10,000 Chinese  - or one in nine of the entire registered Chinese population in Spain - work around the clock in what appears to be a chaotic rabbit warren of warehouses and makeshift shops. But as Ming, 43, who did not want to give his full name because of the shady nature of his business, has been working here for seven years soon makes clear, appearances can be deceptive. It is in the Cabo Calleja where the rising Chinese economic dragon  crashes into the west and turns into a well-oiled money-making machine.

Every week he flies in supplies from his home province, Guangdong,  where he deals with  factories. They are then sold  or shipped to shops around the country. 'This is four times cheaper than if these clothes were made in Spain,'  Mr Ming said, pointing to a collection of his goods. His bargains included wedding dresses retailing for HK$200.

The  Financial Services Authority fined the banking group GBP10.5million and expects it to pay GBP29.3million in compensation for consumer finance misselling. Tracey McDermott, acting director of enforcement and financial crime at the FSA, said  the HSBC offshoot, Nursing Home Fees Agency,  had breached the trust of vulnerable and elderly customers by selling them unsuitable products.

He is due to take up his post in early March 2013. This comes as commercial television network ITV said it had paid out ¬£125,000 (HK$1.5 million) to former Tory party treasurer Lord Alistair McAlpine who was wrongly linked to child sex abuse by one of its programmes and the BBC. ITV apologised \"unreservedly\" to Lord McAlpine, who is at the centre of a row that felled the BBC's director-general, and said they had agreed to pay his legal costs on top of th"

The Philosophy of the Right to Development Abreast with the Times\nII. The System Ensuring the People's Right to Development\nIII. Effectively Realizing Economic Development\nIV. Enhancing Political Development\nV. Promoting Cultural Progress\nVI. Promoting Social Development\nVII. Accelerating Environment-Friendly Development\nVIII. Promoting Common Development\nDevelopment is a universal human theme, providing for people's basic needs and giving them hope of better life. The right to development is an inalienable human right, symbolizing dignity and honor. Only through development can we address global challenges; only through development can we protect basic civil rights of the people; only through development can we promote the progress of human society.\nChina, with a population of over 1.3 billion, is the largest developing country in the world. Development is the top priority of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in governance and national revitalization, and the key to resolving all other problems. Based on its prevailing conditions, China adheres to the Chinese socialist path and to the philosophy that development is of paramount importance. China integrates the principle of universal application of human rights with the country's reality. While striving to enhance the people's wellbeing through development and materialize their right to development, China endeavors to achieve higher-level development by protecting their right to development. In this regard, China has made notable progress and blazed a path in protecting human rights during the development of human civilization.\nSince the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinpingas its core has highlighted the idea of people-centered development. In the course of realizing the Two Centenary Goals [Note: The two goals are to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects by the centenary of the CPC (founded in 1921) and to build China into a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, and harmonious by the centenary of the People's Republic of China (founded in 1949).] and the Chinese Dream of revitalizing the Chinese nation, it has focused on safeguarding and improving people's wellbeing, advancing all social programs, and protecting people's rights to equal participation and development. The aim is to share development benefits and achieve common prosperity among all people of the country.\nOn the 30th anniversary of the publication of the \"Declaration on the Right to Development by the United Nations,\" China, dedicated to advocating, practicing and promoting the right to development, is willing to join the international community to share its philosophy and experience in this regard and to boost sound development of global human rights.\nI.The Philosophy of the Right to Development Abreast with the Times\nEqual access to development opportunities and development benefits are the ideals of human society wherein each and every citizen can achieve well-rounded development and enjoy full right to development.\nThe Chinese people are diligent, wise, innovative and progressive. In traditional Chinese culture, concepts such as \"moderate prosperity\" (xiao-kang), \"great harmony\" (datong), \"having ample food and clothing\" (fengyi zushi) and \"living and working in peace and contentment\" (anju leye) fully reflect the Chinese people's aspiration for and pursuit of a better, happier life. In the long course of history, the Chinese people have always striven for better and shared development opportunities, conditions and benefits. In ancient times, China was for long the world leader in agriculture, and contributed to human progress with extraordinary development achievements. Studies reveal that until the mid-19th century, China's GDPand per capita GDP were the world's highest. Before the 16th century, China contributed 173 of the world's top 300 innovations and discoveries.\nAfter the Industrial Revolution started in the 18th century, China began losing its leadership. Foreign aggression and expansion by Western colonialists completely destroyed condition"

Dozens of editors were sent home to pen essays detailing their failings for publishing I Object, a book on China's first independent election candidate, which irritated senior National People's Congress officials and prompted the General Administration of Press and Publication (Gapp) to penalise the company. The accused were ordered to read their confessions at internal meetings and convince others of the sincerity of their words before being allowed back to their desks.  Officials were also summoned to Beijing to explain their actions to censors and publication officials. I Object was recalled and pulped, and the publishing house had its publication quota slashed. But for all the activity, not a word about it reached the public - the Hainan  editors, like many of their counterparts at other penalised publishing houses - were ordered to keep quiet. There were to be no disclosures of the penalties and no complaints I Object was one of eight books banned by Gapp for overstepping lines on content determined by the administration, the Central Publicity Department and various administrative agencies. Despite the apparent silence of the publishing industry, the long-standing game of cat and mouse between censors and publishers has continued behind the scenes. Top Beijing book distributor Liu Suli  said the silence should be regarded as a quiet rebellion rather than a compromise by the publishers, who generally did not dare to express their anger directly. 'Their administrative resources are controlled by the authorities. If you protest, you will lose all freedom in this industry to publish books,' Mr Liu said. All publications are controlled by authorities, led by Gapp and the Central Publicity Department. Publishing house staff  enjoy  the benefits of a government official, including titles, fixed salaries and allowances, and the only arbiter of their performance is how well they satisfy the needs of authorities.

Cases of successful use of data, big or small, are abundant, but so are the failures to do so. A recent survey of more than 100 executives conducted at Insead indicates that more than half of the companies are still in the planning phases of using big data or have not even started to consider the potential, with less than a third already executing some big data projects. Many firms invested in big data technologies to have a cost advantage According to a recent study of executives in Asia-Pacific by the Economist Intelligence Unit, more than 40 per cent are not even sure their companies have any big data strategy, and only 6 per cent consider their companies as well advanced in adoption. However, well over 70 per cent do believe in the potential of big data to improve business performance. The gap between aspiration and practice is still large, as expected during the hype period of any potential innovation, but the challenges are common and the value is real. Research does show the benefits companies can reap from big data: investments in big data technologies and the use of data to support business decisions do have an impact on a firm's productivity, which is measurable, as expected, with data. Big data, often driven by digitisation, has been affecting many aspects of business, marketing and sales being among the early adopters, according to our research.

This year's report should make some interesting reading. The foundation wages an ideological campaign in the name of the free market. 'Only when they increase the economic freedom of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of the free market will the poor countries of the world begin to achieve true prosperity and economic growth. Anything short of this is not only economically unwise, but inhumane.'  It argues for a strict definition of freedom to be applied to economies: 'Absence of government coercion or constraint on the production, distribution, or consumption of goods and services'. Hong Kong, lauded as the bastion of true capitalism, has consistently scored top marks in the survey. In this year of Government intervention - first to dramatically increase housing supply and then, backtracking, to bolster property prices, and with its moves towards establishment of the Mandatory Provident Fund (mandatory, you understand) - it is likely the foundation will pucker its libertarian lips in distaste. Leaving aside such aberrant Government behaviour, to what extent is Hong Kong's economy free? By the foundation's own admission, 'countries that have the most economic freedom also have higher rates of economic growth and are more prosperous than those having less economic freedom'. Well, Hong Kong is certainly prosperous, having a gross domestic product per capita greater than that of most European countries. But it also has a great skewing of wealth; outside of Singapore - another favourite of the foundation - the most skewed in the developed world. Does this work to the benefit of privileged cartels and cliques?  One businessman who has been based in Hong Kong has plenty"

Some would say eccentricity, Virgin Atlantic would say 'fun'; and the Urban Council ticketing system, known for its pragmatism, would note all three are booked by the same promoter to come to Hong Kong in October and November.\nThe Autumn Fun Festival, announced yesterday, is a hat trick of international acts including the successful British percussion group Stomp, award-winning Venetian comic Ennio Marchetto, and the Russian Ice Stars performing Sleeping Beauty to Tchaikovsky in a show that would be the most traditional - if it didn't involve making the Academy for Performing Arts Lyric Theatre into an ice rink for a fortnight.\nThey come under the umbrella of 'fun' - but another common thread for all three acts is that of transformation.\nThe percussionists in Stomp use anything as drums - except drums. So there is a kitchen utensil samba reggae, a pedal bin steel drum band and a matchbox salsa.\nThe high-energy dance, drumming and comedy group started as a street act in Brighton in 1981, crashed their way on to the touring scene in 1991, landed on Broadway and have since appeared on TV, in ads and movies.

But instead of making the teachers frown, the noise is welcomed. To a newcomer the classroom looks no different from any other - except that it is wired.\nThe room is not a venue for clandestine activity, however. It is a haven for deaf children like Ng Man-hung, aged six, who can now hear his own yawn and sing his favourite song in time and in tune. Because of a new hearing-aid system, he can also communicate with others, even if he is not facing them and cannot read their lips.\nTeleloop, developed by Danish company Oticon, enables the deaf to pick up sounds that would normally be obscured by background noise with a traditional hearing device.

As the Chief Secretary for Administration, Anson Chan Fang On-sang, rightly pointed out, such behaviour is at odds with the 'one country, two systems' principle, and could cast a shadow over Hong Kong's exercise of a high degree of autonomy.\nEven more damaging was Tung Chee-hwa's ambiguous response. He hinted at some sympathy for Mr Xu's complaints and appeared to place freedom of speech on a par with positive presentation of government policies. The subsequent elaboration by the Chief Executive still left room for doubt as to how well he understands the need for RTHK to exercise editorial independence.\nWhether couched in Mr Tung's cautious tones or Mr Xu's more forthright manner, such criticisms do not appreciate the role and value of a public broadcaster. Its essential job is to serve the interests of the community rather than those of government. That distinction is vital. It is why such broadcasters deserve public funding in the first place, and why RTHK's editorial independence is essential if it is to perform its proper task.\nA public broadcaster cannot be required to put a favourable gloss on ever"

What began with a few posters emblazoned with a radical idea, that Hong Kong should split with China and become independent, eventually engulfed the entire political and academic establishment in the latest clash over shrinking freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. Student representatives at the Chinese University of Hong Kong faced off last month with mainland classmates who screamed their opposition to the political signs and attempted to cover them, while middle-aged pro-China protesters shouted they were nothing more than ‚ÄúBritish dogs‚Äù. In response to the three-week confrontation, the heads of all 10 universities in Hong Kong penned a joint statement saying ‚Äúfreedom of expression is not absolute‚Äù and described calls for independence as ‚Äúabuses‚Äù.

  "text": "What was it and when did it begin? The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was a decade-long period of political and social chaos caused by Mao Zedong‚Äôs bid to use the Chinese masses to reassert his control over the Communist party. Its bewildering complexity and almost unfathomable brutality was such that to this day historians struggle to make sense of everything that occurred during the period. However, Mao‚Äôs decision to launch the ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù in May 1966 is now widely interpreted as an attempt to destroy his enemies by unleashing the people on the party and urging them to purify its ranks. When the mass mobilisation kicked off party newspapers depicted it as an epochal struggle that would inject new life into the socialist cause. ‚ÄúLike the red sun rising in the east, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is illuminating the land with its brilliant rays,‚Äù one editorial read. In fact, the Cultural Revolution crippled the economy, ruined millions of lives and thrust China into 10 years of turmoil, bloodshed, hunger and stagnation. Gangs of students and Red Guards attacked people wearing ‚Äúbourgeois clothes‚Äù on the street, ‚Äúimperialist‚Äù signs were torn down and intellectuals and party officials were murdered or driven to suicide. After violence had run its bloody course, the country‚Äôs rulers conceded it had been a catastrophe that had brought nothing but ‚Äúgrave disorder, damage and retrogression‚Äù. An official party reckoning described it as a catastrophe which had caused ‚Äúthe most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the party, the country, and the people since the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic‚Äù in 1949. Whose idea was it and what was the aim? The Cultural Revolution was the brainchild of China‚Äôs ‚ÄòGreat Helmsman‚Äô, Chairman Mao Zedong. Seventeen years after his troops seized power, Mao saw his latest political campaign as a way of reinvigorating the communist revolution by strengthening ideology and weeding out opponents. ‚ÄúOur objective is to struggle against and crush those persons in authority who are taking the capitalist road... so as to facilitate the consolidation and development of the socialist system,‚Äù one early directive stated. Frank Dik√∂tter, the author of a new book on the period, says Mao hoped his movement would make China the pinnacle of the socialist universe and turn him into ‚Äúthe man who leads planet Earth into communism.‚Äù But it was also an attempt by the elderly dictator, whose authority had been badly hit by the calamitous Great Famine of the 1950s, to reassert control over the party by obliterating enemies, real or imagined. ‚ÄúIt was a power struggle waged... behind the smokescreen of a fictitious mass movement,‚Äù Belgian scholar Pierre Ryckmans wrote in his damning account of the Cultural Revolution, The Chairman‚Äôs New Clothes. How exactly did it start? Most historians agree the Cultural Revolution began in mid-May 1966 when party chiefs in Beijing issued a document known as the ‚ÄúMay 16 Notification‚Äù. It warned that the party had been infiltrated by counter-revolutionary ‚Äúrevisionists‚Äù who were plotting to create a ‚Äúdictatorship of the bourgeoisie‚Äù. A fortnight later, on 1 June, the party‚Äôs official mouthpiece newspaper urged the masses to ‚Äúclear away the evil habits of the old society‚Äù by launching an all-out assault on ‚Äúmonsters and demons‚Äù. Chinese students sprung into action, setting up Red Guard divisions in classrooms and campuses across the country. By August 1966 - so-called Red August - the mayhem was in full swing as Mao‚Äôs allies urged Red Guards to destroy the ‚Äúfour olds‚Äù - old ideas, old customs, old habits and old culture. Schools and universities were closed and churches, shrines, libraries, shops and private homes ransacked or destroyed as the assault on ‚Äúfeudal‚Äù traditions began. Gangs of teenagers in red armbands and military fatigues roamed the streets of cities such as Beijing and Shanghai setting upon those with ‚Äúbourgeois‚Äù clothes or reactionary haircuts. ‚ÄúImperialist‚Äù street signs were torn down. Party officials, teachers and intellectuals also found themselves in the cross-hairs: they were publicly humiliated, beaten and in some cases murdered or driven to suicide after vicious ‚Äústruggle sess"

'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,' he smirked, characterising the current race for his successor as he sees it.\nOne of the candidates is his wife, Pining 'Pinky' Ginez, 24. They met when she was 17 during the Miss Santa Maria beauty pageant in which she was runner-up.\nAnd one of her six opponents is his ex-live-in lover. Josefina 'Pining' Bejar Ginez, a 61-year-old grain trader, is indeed an angry woman. Not only did she help finance his previous campaigns, she said the man she lived with for 22 years, until his marriage last December ended their relationship, had promised her that she 'could be mayor' when he could no longer hold office.\nServing his third and constitutionally mandated final term, Mr Ginez, 46, admittedly is reluctant to give up power.\nSo he has Pinky 'pinch-hitting' for him, an increasingly common practice across the country as men who are being forced out of office because of term limits use their wives or daughters to front for them while they still control the local scene from the back seat.\nPining could think of four towns surrounding Santa Maria that fit that scenario.\nIn Santa Maria, the bizarre story of Pinky, Pining and Jose is less a parade of the wackiness of Philippine elections as it is a sordid tale of the abuse of power rampant in local politics here.\nAside from her personal vendetta, Pining argues that her former lover is simply a crook once acquitted of murder who is now using intimidation and money to maintain his control over their small town.\nBut he is having none of that. Community leaders believe only Pinky as the mayor could sustain the peace and order, growth and development he achieved, he says, through programmes that supposedly turned around the town of some about 24,000. And to make sure she does the job properly, he has been teaching her the rudiments of politics and training her to depend on herself."

India's economy is now probably growing faster than China's, for the first time since Deng Xiaoping launched his economic reforms 20 years ago.\nChina's economic growth rate has been falling every year since 1992 - hitting just eight per cent at the end of last year - and some fear the economy may keep slowing down this year.\nThe real growth rate is almost certainly slower than the official one, as the China Economic Times admitted publicly last week. Factories and provinces habitually exaggerate their figures, so the growth rate is often assumed to be one or two per cent less, if not three or four per cent lower, than the official statistics.\nChina has probably been growing at a rate of below six per cent for the past two years, while India's domestic economy expanded by 7.7 per cent between April 1996 and March 1997, and probably by six per cent in the year up to March 1998. And unlike with China, many economists assume that official figures underrate the size of India's economy by up to 50 per cent given the notorious reluctance of Indians to pay their taxes.\nThis is a historic and quite unexpected reversal of positions. The leaders of India's 950 million people have been much maligned for plodding along at a Hindu rate of growth. For decades this averaged not much more than three per cent.\n'India the tortoise' was how author Jim Rohwer described it in Asia Rising when he unfavourably compared the two countries' development since 1949. On almost every measurable count, he argued, China had done better than India, a judgment which probably still holds true.\nBy contrast, China, with 1.2 billion people, is routinely hailed as the new superpower, and Chinese leaders praised for running the world's fastest-growing economy.\nNow it is lagging behind India, which even these days no one would dare call an economic miracle.\nInevitably, the vastly differing performances of the two, one a vibrant pluralistic multiparty democracy, and the other a drab, ruthless communist dictatorship, has provided much grist for the mills of ideologues of differing political hues. And the next few weeks will give a new twist to the Asian-values debate.\nIndia is now in the midst of a democratic election of the sort which President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders claim is impossible in a nation as populous, large and ill-educated as China. So while Indians are casting their ballots, China is about to embark on its annual two-week debate-free excursion to the National People's Congress.\nThis week, China has been mourning the first anniversary of Deng's death, and the stark contrast between the two countries suggests that much of Dengism, while it did a great deal for China, has now reached the end of its natural shelf life. China is clearly having to chart new economic and political reforms never attempted when Deng was in power.\nMr Jiang declared that China would hold up the banner of Deng theory for ever.\nSticking closely to democratic centralism while opening up the economy had been a key tenet of Dengism, yet for the first time in years Chinese newspapers and economists are speaking more openly about the need for political reforms, and taking advantage of the opportunity presented by "

Available in black yellow or blue and green, its 136¬∞ eye view lens has a cover that instantly deactivates the device, perhaps to put your dinner companion at ease. No such privacy exists with the Clip, whose 36x36x9mm size and barely there 20g weight make it a much smaller, more hidden device. Judged purely on wearability, it's an easy win for the less intrusive Clip. But those same clandestine characteristics could make it socially unacceptable in company. ¬† FEATURES Both are about producing spontaneous, hands-free photos. And it's here the Autographer's extra bulk makes sense; inside it is a Bluetooth module that's capable of streaming pictures to a smartphone, but also a GPS unit and five in-built movement sensors (comprising an accelerometer, magnetometer, temperature, colour and infrared motion detector) "

It is a great and separate skill indeed.¬† It is more than composing a dance. In the olden days, nattuvanars perhaps never thought of it that way. They seemed to be content with composing dance, inserting and interpreting hasta and pada abhinaya. A wider concept of dance presentation with proper management of space, auditorium, ambience, props, backdrop, artistic direction of music, sets, lights, colour and so many other things make dance choreography a wholesome skill. Thus, it is not just depiction of a pada word-to-word but about comprehensive treatment.\nThe complete colourful imagery that a successful dance choreographer tries to create materialises in a very subjective and personal interpretation of ideas. The legendary Uday Shankar and, later on, Rukmini Devi are pioneers of classical dance choreography, in its wider sense.\nIn Bharatanatyam, all varieties of emotions are expressed through eyes, face, limbs and through every part of the body.¬† According to the demands of varied emotions, these are used and the level of their usage is determined by the choreography. A few emotions are expressed wonderfully by using angikas only. Nritta (pure technique) and abhinaya (mime or expression) are the most important elements of Bharatanatya. Its nritta comprises intricate rhythmic footwork that includes strikes, extensions, jumps and leaps, plus the complicated patterns made by the hands and arms, all stemming from an extended, dynamic torso.¬† In this way, it is noteworthy that the dancer‚Äôs whole body becomes geometry in motion.\nBharatanatyam is bhakti and shringara oriented and has intimate connections with Indian mythology and culture. Carnatic music has been its live wire. The combinations and subtleties of the movements and themes, their close connections with Carnatic music generate a rare union of complexity and accessibility, in Bharatanatya sensibilities, leading to the creation of dance of great beauty.\nA senior-most disciple of guru Lalitha Srinivasan and a seasoned dan"

Since the United States still counts itself as the world's policeman, there was no possible way for it to avoid the recriminations that have flown its way in the wake of India's first nuclear tests in 24 years.\nWhile the US may not deserve to be placed in the stocks in the global village square for its failure to deter New Delhi from its provocative actions, there can be no doubt the event has driven a truck through what Washington believed to be its well-conceived South Asia policy.\nThe reddest faces in the US capital belong to the nation's spies and their bosses. The CIA has admitted it did not have an inkling the Indian Government was about to conduct the three underground tests, and has launched an internal inquiry to find out where it went wrong.\nGiven the huge global reach and technological superiority of the satellite and aerial surveillance systems run by the CIA and the Pentagon's ultra-secret National Security Agency, it is somewhat embarrassing that no one detected what must have been large deployments of personnel and equipment at the only possible nuclear test site of a power known to be developing a nuclear weapons programme.\nThese, it should be remembered, are the same crack spies who provide the administration with what often seems like weekly intelligence reports on the transfer of Chinese technology to Pakistan and Iran, or the chemistry classes alleged to take place in Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces.\nEmbarrassment must also be felt at the State Department, where Madeleine Albright met India's foreign minister only two days before the blasts and was given no warning by the representative of one of America's supposed allies.\nThe administration knows, of course, that it is rare for any nation - including the US - to broadcast its intentions in advance of such an important national security event.

On the other hand, the advantage is you will probably end up with a lot of complimentary dishes.\nSuch was the case lunching with Albert Cheng King-hon, talk show host and general pain in the authorities' behinds. He is not a man one misses easily. He looks familiar and certainly sounds familiar. Our choice of restaurant was his, a big vegetarian eatery hidden within the dull, grey industrial buildings of Kowloon Bay.\nNaturally, he was recognised; he is, after all, friends with the owner, Thomas Chung, and before I finished reading the starters' list on the menu, Mr Chung was already suggesting our lunch dishes. Sipping his heung pin tea, Cheng told me he had been abstaining from meat for the past two years. 'I'm afraid of dying,' he joked. A minute later he conceded it was to stay healthy.\nBut he is not one of the fussy ones who do not touch anything with meat stock in it. 'It makes people fed-up because it would be such a hassle dining with you. Since I am not a vegetarian because of religious reasons, it is not so bad.

In Taiwan, for example, the percentage of seven-year-old children suffering from nearsightedness rose from 5.8 per cent in 1983 to 21 per cent in 2000. An incredible 81 per cent of Taiwanese 15-year-olds are myopic. The prevalence of high myopia, an extreme form of the disorder, has more than doubled in Asia since the 1980, and children who suffer myopia early in life are more likely to progress to high myopia. High myopia is a risk factor for such serious problems as retinal detachment, glaucoma, early onset cataracts and blindness. The explosion of myopia is a serious public health concern and doctors have struggled to identify the source of the problem. A variety of risk factors has been linked to the disorder: Frequent reading, participation in sports, television watching, protein intake and depression. When each risk factor was isolated, however, its overall effect on myopia rates seemed to be fairly minimal. But researchers believe they are now closing in on a primary culprit: Too much time indoors.¬† In 2008 orthoptic"

It is just such material that gives Trollope's work its immediacy.\nThis time, Trollope has directed her gaze to step-families. Her publisher notes that by 2010 there will be more step-families than birth families in Britain - a trend that will become more pronounced in Hong Kong as the divorce rate rises. And although Trollope focuses on two relationships, the great network of people drawn into the story because of their links with those relationships serves to illustrate how many lives are touched by changes in one family's circumstances.\nAs the parties to those two new relationships struggle to deal with other people's children, it quickly becomes obvious the past cannot be shrugged off.\nThe new relationships cannot exist independently of what ha"

Under the Basic Law, the election of our future chief executives and lawmakers will be  conducted according to Hong Kong's actual situation and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. However, the continuation of the district council appointment system is a direct contradiction of the principle of gradual progress. The appointment system was abolished before the handover but reinstated by  then-chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, who  wanted to diminish the political power of  pan-democrats.

If you start with the obvious - Barbra Streisand, Penny Marshall, Penelope Spheeris - and move on to lesser-known but popular directors such as Antonia Bird (Priest ), Sally Potter (Orlando ), Gillian Armstrong (Little Women ), Jocelyn Moore-house (How to Make an American Quilt ) and Mira Nair (Kama Sutra ), you're still only up to eight.\nDedicated film fans may be able to string a longer list together, but not in the commercial arena.

That leaves a problem, especially with summer bearing down on the region and the desire that most of us have at some point to take a dip. However, even if the building you live in doesn't have a pool, don't get frustrated. There are plenty of pools available in and around Hong Kong - run by the Government, universities and hotels. Hotels Almost all hotels in Hong Kong have pools. Those that are open to the public include Century Hong Kong Hotel, the Mandarin Oriental (opposite), the Regent, the Regal Hong Kong, Conrad, JW Marriott, the Sheraton and Kowloon Shangri-La. The facilities tend to be less busy, but you can expect to be asked to pay a good deal of cash for a day's membership and the pools tend to be on the small side. If money really is no object, a full day on the Regent's spa programme comes in at between $3,600 and $3,900. That includes a harbour-view room for the day, as well as a facial, body care treatment and a massage. To make a booking call 2721 1211.

Led by director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), these 'craftsmen' take themselves very seriously, in a hilarious take on the Ed Wood school of film-making.\nBoogie Nights is not sexy, though, nor is it really about sex. In fact, the main problem with this admittedly endearing feature is deciding exactly what it has set out to say. Horner, Diggler, 'mother figure' Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), and Rollergirl (Heather Graham) breathe new life into the adage 'home is where the heart is', but that is a shaky premise on which to drag an audience through two hours of sex, cocaine and violence.\nIn other words, while it is funny, technic"

This month, we reported that the writing was on the wall following Rusal's announcement that it was nominating Matthias Warnig for a seat as an independent non-executive director on its board. Warnig is apparently telling some people that he is to be the next chairman of Rusal. Warnig is head of Nord Stream, which operates the gas pipeline from Russia to Europe, and is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which seems to count for a lot in this situation. He was previously chairman of the board at Russian pipeline giant Transneft, and a member of the supervisory board of Russian bank VEB. Putin was apparently irritated, maybe even annoyed, that his wish for a Russian to chair Rusal was not carried out when Barry Cheung was appointed chairman in March, after Viktor Vekselberg acrimoniously resigned. Cheung, who is chairman of the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange, was presumably appointed because he was trusted by Deripaska, who did not want another troublesome oligarch as chairman. Cheung is also Chinese, which is a plus since Rusal is desperate to make inroads into the China market. Its share price tumbled to an all-time low on May 18, to HK$4.44, or 59 per cent below its IPO price of HK$10.80. It closed yesterday at"

Securities dealers will take an hour-and-a-half lunch break from March 7 next year and around a year after  will just have an hour to finish their lunch. They currently have a two-hour break from 12.30pm. They will also have to start work earlier because trading hours will begin at 9.30am instead of 10am. Extending the trading hours will help the exchange stay competitive, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing chairman Ronald Arculli told reporters, adding that the decision to introduce longer trading hours had been well received following consultation with the financial industry. Rather than cutting the lunch break to just one hour next year straight away, Arculli said it will be easier for everyone if it was reduced by half-hour next year and another half-hour the year after. From March 7, 2011, trading will be from 9.30am to noon and then from 1.30pm until 4pm. And from 2012, trading begins "

But what happens when the exercise of such a cherished right comes into conflict with a pillar of Hong Kong's free and open society - an independent judiciary? That is the situation in the case of Amina Bokhary,  a member of a prominent family who was convicted of slapping a police officer - the third time she had been convicted of assaulting an officer - but who has never been jailed. The magistrate placed her on probation for a year,  fined her HK$5,000  for refusing to give a breath sample and an additional HK$3,000  for careless driving. Some of the local media  played up the fact that she is the niece of Mr Justice Kemal Bokhary,  who sits on the Court of Final Appeal. Last week, several hundred people dressed in black marched in protest against what they saw as an overly lenient sentence. Tens of thousands of other people signified on Facebook their dissatisfaction with the way the case was handled. Demonstrations are part of Hong Ko"

Romanian right back Dan Petrescu races down the left flank, fending off the limpet-like attentions of England defender Graeme Le Saux.\nGoalkeeper David Seaman advances to meet the danger. As the three converge, Le Saux slides in and gains the crucial contact. The ball trickles out for a corner.\nSeconds later at the other end, English striker Michael Owen crashes the ball in off the post. England win 2-1.\nA fantasy, of course, as England fans know - but one that may be coming to a computer screen near you in the not-too-distant future.\nThe most wired World Cup yet has offered a glimpse of how information technology is poised to transform the business of sports broadcasting and entertainment.\nBy the next World Cup in 2002, we could be watching games on a box which functions as television and Internet access terminal.\nBy 2006, we may have dispensed with television sets altogether, watching the games on holograms on the table.\nAnd before long, we could be playing computer games of stunning realism that allow us to simulate actual games, past or future.\nThis could mean the chance to rewrite history in the case of a disagreeable result.\n'In another four years, the Internet is going to be huge.

The loan-delinquency ratio declined to 1.14 per cent last month from May's 1.16 per cent, according to figures released by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. During the month, residential-mortgage lending rose slightly after a sharp rise in May. Deputy chief executive of the authority David Carse said the decline was encouraging. 'However, a longer run of figures will be required to determine whether this is the start of a prolonged downward trend,' he said. It was the first drop in the ratio since the authority started collecting the relevant statistics in June last year. The number of overdue home-loan repayments had been on the rise, as borrowers were hit by the economic downturn and rising unemployment, analysts said. Property agents said the drop in the delinquency ratio indicated that the housing market had become stable and predicted it would continue to ease. The ratio, at 1.14 per cent, remaine"

So does at least one provisional legislator.\nThe longtime member watched, intrigued, as policy secretaries responded to a signal from Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen calling them to his table, seemingly to propose a toast to the Chief Secretary for Administration at the farewell banquet for interim legislators.\n'It's so odd that they ignored the chief executive . . . They did not propose a toast to Tung,' he said.\nSpeculation about the uneasy ties between Mr Tung and his top aides was fuelled further by the quiet early exit of Mrs Chan and Mr Tsang, ostensibly without notifying their boss.\nAsked about the episode, a senior official claimed the legislator was too sensitive, explaining: 'It was quite chaotic at the time. Suddenly, Donald rose and sent an eye signal to some policy secretaries to come over. We got the message and gathered around his table. Anson was at the same table. We then started a round to toast different tables.\n'Yes. Both Anson and Donald left earlier. I was about to leave "

There are about 300,000 SMEs, which the Government defines as manufacturing companies with less than 100 staff or less than 50 in the service sector.\nSMEs account for 98 per cent of all companies in the SAR. More than 100,000 of these SMEs are trading firms, with five employees on average.\nFrancis Ngai, general business manager of IBM Hong Kong\/China, estimated that four out of 10 SMEs might not have a single computer installed in their office, with many others only partly computerised.\n'This is a great opportunity,' he said.\nSMEs buy about 27 per cent of the 406,000 desktop and notebook PCs and PC servers sold in Hong Kong, according to technology consultancy IDC.\nThese smaller companies spend a disproportionate amount on hardware. Their software needs are basic and limited usually to bundled productivity applications such as Microsoft Office. Smaller companies also typically are not heavy networking users.\nKitty Fok, senior PC market analyst for IDC, believes growth in personal computer sales to SMEs this year will not surpass last year's rate, due to the economic slowdown.\nSales of PCs to SMEs grew 22 per cent last year, faster than the 18 per cent overall growth in PC sales in Hong Kong. IDC forecasts SME sales will rise only 10 per cent this year - the same as the overall market.\nMs Fok also doubted whether the large US vendors, which sold 35 per cent of the c"

Halady (South China Morning Post, December 26 and 30) present a very one-sided view of litigation against the tobacco industry. Their claim that tobacco companies are absolved from any responsibility for the lethal effects of their products has not been accepted by the judiciary in more than one country. This is due, at least in part, to the discovery that the tobacco industry's research led, several decades ago, to detailed evidence that smoking would damage health. As explained by Edward L. Sweda (Post, January 1), the previously secret industry documents also reveal how tobacco companies spent vast sums to conceal this information and obfuscate and deny the conclusions reached by independent medical researchers.

While this may be true, Unix started life as plain old vanilla.\nThe Unix system code was created at AT&T's Bell Laboratories in the early 1970s and given away free. It was adopted by government, university and research institutions, which began developing versions.\nHardware vendors developed variations to suit proprietary systems in a competitive strategy to offer the 'best' version. They used the multi-user Unix OS as a master control system in workstations and servers.\nEach believed it could rule the market if only it could come up with a version that everyone wanted. It led to a fractured market.\nOne outcome has seen Microsoft's Windows NT steal clients in the server and workstation sector.\nLong-standing Unix flavours include Sun Microsystems' Solaris Unix, Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX, IBM's AIX, Digital's Unix and Silicon Graphics' SGI IRIX.\nThey face a declining market share as NT grows in popularity due to its lower system costs, ease of use and confusion over Unix flavours.\nNT server sales grew 80 per cent in 1997 year on year, according to International Data Corp.

Observant readers will have noticed that among the eight mugshots in the advert, titled 'Congratulations to N.T. Land Group's new share launch', were actors Sean Lau Ching-wan and Alex Fong Chung-Sun. Yet the blurring of fiction and reality did not stop there. The portrait of Lau, wearing sunglasses, bore an uncanny resemblance to Heu ng Yee Kuk's Sheung Shui rural leader Hau Chi-keung. Meanwhile, Fong's bob haircut was reminiscent of the signature style of businessman and former triad leader Kwok Wing-hung, aka Shanghai Boy, who once caused a stir by attending a dinner involving aides of Leung Chun-ying before CY's election as chief executive in 2012.

There is still much charm, despite the modern intrusion of glittering towers and the murky curtain behind which Kowloon has retreated. Five years ago, Kou and her husband moved in and on this fine stage she began to introduce her friends to the art of The Occasion.\nAs Asian managing director of the fashion company Escada, she has a good sense of both the visual and the theatrical. There have been maharajah parties, Hollywood Oscar nomination parties ('I was Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman') and fireworks parties. She tries hard to avoid being predictable - on the night of the handover she had a Brazilian party complete with band, tropical-themed marquees at the front and back of the house, and energetic lambada dancing by 160 guests.\nNot that her socialising is always on such a large scale. More intimate dinner parties for up to a dozen people are held at the house too, and that's when Kou likes to plan her table settings. 'I love cosy areas to eat in, and I'm always exploring corners here to use as a different environment for dining,' she says. At the moment, she has four favourite spaces around her home which she themes according to season, food and guests' preferences.\nWhen the weather is cool, she serves hot pot out on the terrace with heaters wheeled alongside to take off the chill of the night; there are also roller blinds which can be lowered during rainstorms.\nThe effect Kou creates is stimulated by her love of Bali.

After struggling for so long to cling to office, it is understandable that many in his country and overseas should be suspicious as to whether the ageing leader has really gone, or plans to continue exercising his rule from behind the scenes.\nSuch suspicions were fuelled by the passing of the presidency to his friend and long-time confidant Bacharuddin Habibie, with the suggestion that this widely-disliked technocrat will continue to serve out the rest of his term in office, which does not end until 2003. But as shown by yesterday's calls for Mr Suharto to stand trial, the situation in Jakarta has changed so dramatically that there is no longer any realistic prospect of him being able to stay on as the power behind the throne, even if that is what he intends.\nNor should anyone expect President Habibie to remain in power for long. He has no power base save for the former President's support, and this is now far more of a liability than an asset. At a time when Mr Suharto has been forced from office in disgrace it is easy to forget the departed leader's considerable achievements during his three decades in power. He brought a long period of stability to this sprawling and ethnically diverse nation, and presided over the reconstruction of its economy, with impressive growth rates being recorded until last year's regional financial crisis.\nBut Mr Suharto al"

It was the sharpest decrease in the country's economy since the first quarter of 1974 when its GDP suffered a decline of 3.4 percent, or an annualized 13.1 percent, due to the fallout of the first oil crisis, said the Cabinet Office in a preliminary report, indicating that Japan's economy has been mired in deeper recession.    Consumer spending, which accounts for about 55 percent of Japan's GDP, saw a 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter fall in real terms while corporate capital spending, a main driver of Japan's six-year economic recovery since 2002, dropped 5.3 percent.    Exports tumbled at the fastest-ever pace of 13.9 percent due to the sharp appreciation of the yen amid the global economic recession, and imports, on the other hand, expanded 2.9 percent.

But to many people walking out with a steaming cup of java, a barista is just the person who serves them a shot of caffeine rather than someone skilled at making espresso-based drinks. Chan Tsz-king  hopes to change that perception. 'I don't think Hong Kong has a solid coffee culture yet,' says the 26-year-old barista, who works at a trading company's in-house cafe. 'For me, real coffee shouldn't be served in a giant plastic cup or drunk through a slim straw. Many people are now buying caffeine rather than a cup of real enjoyment.' One of 17 people taking part in the city's first barista contest, Chan presents a picture of concentration during the elimination rounds last week. After handing each judge a cup of freshly roasted beans, he presses a button on his music player to send a jazzy tune wafting through the room before packing the ground beans to produce his first cups. Contestants are each required  to produce  four black coffees,  four milk coffees and four lattes  with an identical design on the  foam within 12 minutes, and the six finalists will compete tomorrow  for the title of Hong Kong Grand Barista Champion. Paul Jackson, founder of Australian gourmet coffee company Danes, organised the original competition in Sydney eight years ago to promote excellence in espresso-based drinks and raise industry awareness. Since then,  it has expanded to take in Thailand, South Korea, Singapore and now Hong Kong. The Hong Kong winner will be flown to Sydney to take part in the final next month, with the grand champion awarded a trip to Milan. Craig Jackson, Paul's brother  and a long-time Hong Kong resident, hopes the local competition will help bring  baristas into the limelight here.

He grew up in an apolitical family living in government housing, raised by working-class parents who immigrated to Hong Kong from mainland China. He attended a pro-Beijing secondary school where teachers never had a bad word to say about China‚Äôs authoritarian government and shied away from topics such as human rights and democracy movements. But by his first year of university, Law had committed himself completely to fighting for greater democracy in Hong Kong and challenging China‚Äôs ruling Communist party. In September, at 23, he became the youngest person ever elected to Hong Kong‚Äôs legislature, part of a wave of progressive politicians swept into office in the wake of mass democracy protests in 2014. Law‚Äôs brief legislative career came to an abrupt end last week, when a judge disqualified him and three other lawmakers for failing to read properly the oath of office. For years it has been a tradition among the pro-democracy camp to add small acts of defiance during the swearing-in. But last week, Hong Kong‚Äôs high court ruled that Law‚Äôs actions at the ceremony showed his oath was insincere. He had prefaced his oath with a quote from Gandhi and a pledge to serve the Hong Kong people. ‚ÄúBeijing‚Äôs tactic is very clear: they want to suppress the more progressive voices in Hong Kong,‚Äù he tells the Guardian. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a stick and carrot: they use the stick on the progressive forces, and the carrot with the moderate pro-democracy parties.‚Äù There is a growing movement seeking to resist closer integration with mainland China, which has put activists directly at odds with China‚Äôs leaders, who have increasingly exerted greater control over Hong Kong in response. The Hong Kong government sued to have the four lawmakers removed from office, after successfully barring two pro-independence legislators from taking their seats in November. All six altered their official oaths at a swearing-in ceremony in October 2016, prompting the Chinese government to employ a seldom-used power in the most direct interference in the city‚Äôs politics since the UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.

He is now back on the programme, full of energy and enjoying cooking for himself. Anthony says the most difficult part of the diet is resisting the temptation of fatty foods. 'For me, the more fat, the better,' he said. 'But I don't find the programme too restrictive. I am really enjoying my food and can still eat chicken, fish and beef. I can still drink, although not as much as before and I always drink a glass of water with each glass of wine.' On Jennifer's recommendation, Anthony has cut out coffee and now drinks Chinese tea and boiled water. He snacks on pumpkin and sunflower seeds, which Jennifer says are packed with fatty acids, vital for the healthy functioning of the prostate gland.\nWhen eating out, he has been advised to stay away from cream-based sauces and fatty foods, opting for vegetables, lean meats and salads with the dressing on the side. Jennifer suggests having a snack before going out.\nFrom a gentle jog once a month, his exercise has increased to a daily, 20-minute walk home from work. He also tries to get out walking for an hour or so at the weekend.\nFiona Overton Programme: Bodywatch with Hilary Rowark.\nStarting weight: 75 kg (165 lbs).\nCurrent weight: 71 kg (156 lbs).\nFiona is delighted with her progress but knows she could have been stricter with her wine consumption during nights out (all well earned, of course, with three children under 17 months).\nAs Fiona is still breastfeeding her baby's requirements take priority. 'We haven't been too strict about portion sizes as her needs for calcium, protein and carbohydrate are greater,' says Hilary. In confirmation, Fiona says: 'When I'm having fish I eat the whole fillet, about 150g-200g, instead of the 90g serving size recommended by Bodywatch.' With Fiona's post-natal check-up completed, Hilary is encouraging her to start exercising. 'I have been hoping to get a kickstart on exercise but fitting it in between feeding, bathtime and bedtime is almost impossible and I'm just so exhausted at the end of the day, I physically can't do it,' says Fiona.\nAndrew Rutherford Programme: personal training at Tom Turk's Gym, Central.\nStarting weight: 95.4kg (210 lbs).\nCurrent weight: 93.4kg (205 lbs).\n'I'm having a burger and chips, what are you allowed?' said Andrew when I suggested meeting for lunch to catch up on his progress (he had a Caesar salad).

Chen, a former student organiser, started the tradition when she was in prison, soon after the protests ended, while serving 20 months in an 8 sq metre cell. It was a small, silent act of resistance. The guards did not pay attention to whether she ate or not. Chen is one of many former protesters and activists who will be fasting on Tuesday, the 30th anniversary of the crushing of a nationwide pro-democracy movement, when tanks and soldiers cleared protesters by force, killing hundreds or perhaps thousands. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a sacred day,‚Äù said Chen, who led protests in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou as a university student. It is a day of complicated emotions for Chen, of guilt and grief. ‚ÄúThey died to promote democracy in China and it seems what we have done in the past 20 or 30 years is insignificant.

The debate surrounding the New Jersey rockers is  whether their sound is alt-rock, pop punk, post  hardcore, or 'emo' -  that last label being a particular sore point with the five-piece. 'I think emo is f***ing garbage; it's bull****,'  says lead singer Gerard Way.  Guitar player Ray Toro, however, was kind enough to  explain over the phone from New Jersey last week what emo is and why the quintet hate that description of themselves ahead of the band's  appearance on Tuesday at the AsiaWorld-Arena. 'You don't have emo in Hong Kong?' he  asks. 'Consider yourself lucky.' Toro explains that emo is a musical movement 'based around sh**ty music'. 'Not even so much music as what people are wearing and the kind of haircut they have or whether they're wearing makeup or not,' he says. 'Somehow we got lumped in with that and it's been a sticking issue - a real thorn in our side.' It might have something to do with lead singer Way's predilection for eyeliner and black clothes, and the fact that his lyrics, sung over operatic rock anthems, are often about angst, alienation, vampires and killing his friends. Song titles like Bury Me in Black and It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Deathwish would seem to drive the point home. 'We're constantly asked questions about being the leaders of the emo movement,' Toro says. 'And we end up saying, 'Compare us to any band that you would call emo. Do we sound anything like them? No'' Those comparisons have included Blac"

Training to cope with the conversion to the new system has been under way since October.\nIn a darkened room next to the control tower simulator, five other controllers sit at computers 'flying' up to seven simulated planes. The 'pseudo-pilots' communicate with the other controllers by radio to enhance realism.\nAlso including a simulator that re-creates on controllers' radar screens aircraft approaches from the edge of Hong Kong airspace, the training equipment cost more than $30 million.\n'There's a lot to learn - new system, new equipment, new procedures,' says John Lau To-chuen, deputy air-traffic general manager, in charge of the conversion training. 'But we're talking about training controllers who are experienced at Kai Tak. I'm confident they'll all be ready.'  By April, each controller will have had two and a half weeks of training for Chek Lap Kok in the classroom and on the simulators. The schedule was planned with an April airport opening in mind. Because of the postponement to July 6, controllers will each be required to take a two-day refresher course in early June.\nUnlike the tidy view from the tower simulator, the real Chek Lap Kok still looked like a construction site last week.\nA road tunnel under the runway to the air-traffic control centre was still unfinished. Controllers arriving by bus from Kai Tak were driven over a bumpy dirt track, through a gap in the perimeter fence, then across the apron in front of the terminal building (where rows of planes will soon be parked) to the seven-storey control centre, which is connected by an overhead walkway to the 86-metre-tall control tower.\nThe new airport is expected to have 31 aircraft movements (take-offs and landings) per hour when it opens - the same as for Kai Tak. But controllers are being trained to cope with 40.\nAircraft movements at Chek Lap Kok will be increased to 34 within a month of opening. 'We are aware of the pressure [on controllers],' Mr Lau says. 'We're taking a cautious approach.'  Simulators are the only option for co"

Buhari's All Progressives Congress (APC) highlighted record lows in electricity production, multiple strikes and billions of dollars in debts, suggesting Jonathan's government was deliberately leaving the country in a mess. \"Never in the history of our country has any government handed over to another a more distressed country,\" APC spokesman Lai Mohammed said on Sunday in an emailed statement. \"No electricity, no fuel, workers are on strike, billions are owed to state and federal workers, US$60 billion owed in national debt and the economy is virtually grounded,\" he added.

'It's our aim to make people think. We want people to be questioning more what's going on at the moment,' explains Sam Chambers, 26, one of three Lamma residents who created the site and who's the  editor of Lloyd's List Maritime Asia when he's not working on the revolution.

'It wasn't the right time, we didn't want to offend anyone,' says Eichman. Their anger at the US-led invasion of Iraq and the associated media coverage, however, meant they needed no encouragement to revive the plan.

Yesterday China's statisticians announced that the mainland's property prices climbed by 12.8 per cent over the year to April (see the first chart below). And even that record increase probably understates the true magnitude of the recent price rises. A back-of-the envelope calculation based on official data for floor space sold and transaction volumes indicates a much greater increase. The latest price rise came despite a string of increasingly strict official measures designed to rein in price rises by clamping down on property speculation and increasing the supply of low cost housing reaching the market. In truth April's figures are not all that surprising. The latest round of restrictions came too late in the month to have much of an impact on April's data. Even so, the market's continued fizz appeared to confirm the suspicions of observers who believe the mainland's property market is a dangerous bubble that could burst at any moment wreaking untold damage on the mainland economy. Certainly there are plenty of symptoms of a bubble if you look for them. Analysts at HSBC estimate that the total value of the mainland's housing stock based on market prices now exceeds 109 trillion yuan, or almost 3.3 times China's gross domestic product. To put that ratio into perspective, it is almost double the peak reached by the US property market"

Students and activists have been camped outside the government complex all weekend. Students started the rally but by early Sunday leaders of the broader Occupy Central civil movement said they were joining them to kickstart a long-threatened mass sit-in. Demonstrators barricaded themselves inside the protest zone using metal crowd control barriers originally brought in by authorities. They donned protective gear in case police use pepper spray, wrapping their faces and arms with plastic wrap and wearing cheap plastic raincoats, goggles and surgical masks. Clashes with police and the arrest of several student leaders had brought supporters onto the streets after around 150 demonstrators broke through police lines and stormed the city headquarters late on Friday night, prompting 74 arrests. Three well-known activists were still being held on Sunday morning. Police used pepper spray as they struggled to clear demonstrators from the scene overnight.

Mr Wijedoru sees signs of similar interference in China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Russia and the former Yugoslavia. He then proceeded to undermine this interesting contention by a rapid and simplistic reinterpretation of the causes of World War II, and the nature of the war crimes tribunals that commenced in 1945. Personally I could not care less whether the Austrians vote Mickey Mouse into power, that is their democratic right. However, if a political incumbent holds views that many people find distasteful, one must expect a certain amount of debate.

The policy is designed to help banks better manage the large amounts of debt that local governments have amassed. Roughly 70 per cent of the more than 9 trillion yuan (HK$10.96 billion) that banks have lent to LGFVs is unlikely to be completely repaid by the projects they have funded, exposing top lenders to a high risk of default.

For a currency which has suffered because of concerns about an escalation in political risk in Europe‚Äôs single currency area - and which lost 2.3 per cent against the dollar last month due to fears about the possibility of far-right leader Marine Le Pen winning the decisive round of France‚Äôs presidential election on May 7 - this is quite a rally. There are several reasons why the euro has been strengthening of late. One of them is increasing confidence among international investors that the rising tide of anti-establishment populism that engulfed the US and Britain last year may spare the euro zone. The weaker-than-expected performance of the far right, anti-Islamic party of Geert Wilders in last week‚Äôs Dutch parliamentary election has contributed to the perception among investors that there is now less chance of Le Pen winning the French presidential election - the focal point of market anxiety for the next six weeks.

Therefore, Beijing took the view that India should unconditionally withdraw its troops as a prerequisite, and then bring the matter to the table.

The Japanese agency is lending $300 million for the expansion of Beijing's airport and $400 million for Shanghai's new international airport now under construction at Pudong.\nThe Spanish and Dutch governments also are negotiating concessionary loans of $30 million to assist in the upgrading of airports at Shenyang and Chengdu.\nPolicy and profit constraints effectively sideline foreign commercial capital from financing airports in the way it has backed construction of mainland power stations, highways and water"

'your lover' (upwards of $100,000). These are the types of goods and services you stumble on while surfing Hong Kong's thriving Internet auction sites. While many Americans are addicted to eBay, the growing fascination with cyber wheeling-and-dealing in Hong Kong is a lesser-known phenomenon. Yet sites such as Red-Dots, HK.Auctions and Go2HK are filling the local niche for new and second-hand clothes, cameras, books and, well . . . junk. According to Nielsen\/NetRatings, which monitors Internet use, auction sites are pulling in up to twice the number of bargain-hunters than this time last year. Adding to the trend is an overall Internet shopping boom, since Sars forced Hongkongers off the street and into the safety of their homes. In April, Hong Kong shopping sites were visited 1.1 million times by home Internet users, behind news and education sites with 1.5 million and 1.2 million visits respectively, but ahead of banking and travel sites, which attracted 600,000 and 271,000 visits. By far the most popular shopping site was Yahoo, with 430,000 visitors. 'April was the first 'full Sars month' and traffic increased dramatically as surfers explored sites they wouldn't normally visit,' says Peter Steyn, director of sales and marketing for Nielsen\/NetRatings. 'There was a clear sign that people were surfing the Internet as a substitute for activities that would normally take place away from home.'

But before and after work, they hit the waves hoping to win big at a forthcoming surf competition. Life is challenging for the teenagers as they must choose between career or romance. Starring (above left to right) Michelle Rodriguez (The Fast And The Furious, Girlfight), Kate Bosworth (The Rules Of Attraction, Remember The Titans) and Sanoe Lake (a model\/surfer from Hawaii). Directed by John Stockwell (Crazy\/Beautiful). Roger Ebert The Chicago Sun-Times 'Blue Crush knows something most surfing movies don't acknowledge - that many non-pro surfers endure blue-collar jobs as a way to support their surfing, which is the only time they feel really alive. Surfers in the movies have traditionally been golden boys and girls who ride the waves to Beach Boys songs - and live, apparently, on air. In Blue Crush, we meet three Hawaiian surfers who work as hotel maids and live in a grotty rental.

Some experts say those myths and old wives' tales that have been a part of many people's daily routine could be doing more harm than good. But don't think  the claims of hi-tech beauty creams and so-called clinically tested ingredients have all the answers either. So, how do we separate fact from fiction without breaking the bank or waking up with a  nasty rash? Beijing-based manager of I-Spa, Siririat Fungkhajon, explodes some myths and offers some tips of her own: 1. Body soap on the face isn't a good idea. It might have been the only thing available for previous generations, but things have changed. 'Body and facial skin are different, as are the pH levels found in body soap and face soap,' she says. 'Using a body soap on oily skin can soak up excess oils, but normal and dry skin needs more moisture.' 2. Toothpaste shrinks and dries out blemishes - myth. Girls who would try just about anything to get rid of pimples probably invented this beauty titbit, but don't be tempted, warns Fungkhajon. 'Toothpaste is especially bad for sensitive skin. It's full of chemicals and the  flavourings will irritate and sting. It's best to keep toothpaste for its intended use and if you must, treat blemishes with over-the-counter ointments.' For a natural alternative, Fungkhajon recommends you dab natural yoghurt on the spot to cleanse and remove bacteria. 3. Oily skin doesn't need moisturiser - myth. All skin types need a moisturiser, including oily skin. 'Those with normal or dry skin should use an oil-based moisturiser, while oily skins need a water-based moisturiser,' says Fungkhajon. She says Chinese women often ignore moisturising. 'Chinese skin tends to be drier than other Asian skins, so a moisturiser with sunscreen during the day and a rich night cream before bed will improve the look of the skin.' 4. Chocolate and fried foods cause blemishes - myth. Over-indulging and not eating enough fresh produce can give skin a flat, dull a"

Its rivals have about 70,000, equivalent to about 2 per cent of the market.\nTalk of competition in the domestic market was a fallacy, SBC Warburg Dillon Read telecoms analyst Jason Billings said.\nHong Kong Telecommunication Users Group chairman Simon Chan also is blunt: 'The networks are so small that we do not have a choice.'  Residential customers fare worst. For example, Wharf's New T&T, which is leading the new operators in terms of installed lines, has 41,000. Of those, 37,000 are rented to business users, leaving a mere 4,000 residential connections.\nNew T&T marketing director Tony Cheung admits it has done little to dent Telecom's dominance in the local market. 'The biggest problem for us is delivering access,' he said.\nAccess means the connection between the local exchange and the customer.\nThe problem for the new rivals is that it is not economic to install their own lines to individual customers. Because domestic calls are free, revenues from supplying call services tend to make it not worth the effort.\nLast year, for example, Telecom had a turnover of $5.1 million from its domestic network compared with nearly $17 billion from its international services.\nFor high-volume business customers, the economic argument is much sounder and that naturally is why the new entrants are seeking to sign up commercial rather than residential customers.\nAnother problem pointed to by Mr Cheung is that even when they want to put their own cables into a building, it is not always possible.\n'This is largely due to insufficient space, particularly in old buildings which have room for the equipment of only one company - Hongkong Telecom,' he said.\nDevelopers have been less than co-operative. Under Government rules, they are only advised to co-operate with the new companies, not ordered to do so, which promotes the status quo and favours companies allied with particular developers.\nThe answer to this should be to share Telecom's access"

According to one scenario, nuclear annihilation was a racing certainty; while in the other, we would all dress in white spandex jumpsuits and be generally slack, high on magic pills and blessed with more leisure than the dead. In the end, the first scenario proved wildly wrong - the Cold War fizzled out like a bad party. In this cutthroat age of outsourcing, downsizing and toil, the second scenario now looks totally off. As Futurama creator Matt Groening has observed, we are not very good at envisioning the middle path: the ordinariness of people rummaging around in video shops for plastic boxes. In fact, we are not good at predicting the future at all. I wonder whether Groening ever foresaw that Futurama was doomed to die an early death while his timeless critique of the present, The Simpsons, rolls on.

Their friends may describe it as their new hangout. But for Wilson Chik Wai-chi and Betty Cheung Man-yee, the two partners of the Meli-Melo Artists' Alliance, an informal association of multi-media art enthusiasts, it's the realisation of their vision to bring art and the community together. Chik, 30, and Cheung, 34, are the founders of 123 Wellington Street, a simple name for their not-so-simple idea of creating Hong Kong's first informal art hub. 'We were just walking around the area one day and saw a 'For Rent' sign,' says Cheung, an architect by day and a budding artist by night. 'It was boarded up, so we peered inside through a couple of peepholes. When we saw the inside both of us knew this had the potential to become a place where art could thrive.' And a place that could be home to their pet project. The pair saw the derelict, 1930s three-storey building at a blink-and-miss spot at the end of Wellington Street, an area close to Sheung Wan, where many traditional gold dealers, tea traders and dried-seafood merchants are based. The building at No 123 retains its original first-floor balcony and moulded features on its roof but within three months, Chik and Cheung gave the place a complete make-over and turned it into Hong Kong's newest art space, with the shabby charm of the Fringe Club in its early days. Visitors who manage to find 123 Wellington Street are in for a treat. The ground floor is a soaring space with an air of industrial chic, with exposed beams and wires. There is a small bar area at the back, where coffee and tea will be served. It houses the Meli-Melo Living Arts Cafe, where the speciality isn't food but a 'buffet' of acrylic paint, brushes and canvases. At the front is the 'buffet' table for materials and there are easels and canvases instead of tables and chairs where the popular Art Jam will be held twice a week. 'Art Jam was started in our old hub, which was a 200-square-foot flat in an old building,' Cheung says. Anyone who hasn't the faintest idea what Art Jam is, might visualise art therapy through expression. Each Jam participant gets a blank canvas and basically paints his or her heart out with the cafe's materials. It is an excellent way to release stress or just stretch the mind, Cheung says. There "

Under the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord reached on Oct. 29, the two sides agreed to form a unity government and to hold general elections on Nov. 29.     Opposition candidate Porfirio Lobo claimed victory of the election but the newly elected president is now facing an international division.     Many countries, especially those in Latin America, refuse to recognize the new government and insist on Zelaya's immediate restoration to the presidency.

But now it's private buyers who are counting on  them to give their gardens a  creative dimension. Steve Dilworth, who has produced sculpture for Scotia Pharmaceuticals  and Dundee Council,  works with private clients with a taste for his haunting, sometimes uncomfortable, art. His black granite hand,  Claw, may be at home in the artistic surroundings of Goodwood Sculpture Park in Sussex,  England, but it would take a strong character to install some of his gothic pieces. Not only does his bony Cat and the Rat sculpture (right) look eerie but the story behind it is morbid: it was cast from a cat that died more than 100 years ago after eating poisoned rats. The Scottish sculptor  says: 'I recognise that some people might find some of the things I've made a little difficult but I don't think there is any point in deliberately setting out to upset anyone.' Although some of his works are cast from porpoise carcasses or covered in animal fat, he is just  one of many sculptors catering  to a growing demand from  private clients. His huge rippling Shell, which evokes the protective qualities of love, was recently commissioned by a German collector who took to its inviting multilayered cocoon. 'He has a number of my works already in his collection and the way it evolved was through conversation, scale and place,' Dilworth says. 'It took about three months before going to the foundry and cost #30,000 [HK$412,000]  in total.' With such high prices it may come as a surprise that these sculptors are being pursued by private clients wanting works for their homes. However, sculptor Billy Lee, who is based in the US and has work displayed in the Shanghai Sculpture Park  and the Yuzi Paradise Sculpture Park in Guilin,  says: 'It's the clients who usuall"

Wang, 46, who was sentenced on October 23 to seven years in prison, conducted his fraud on an almost industrial scale, as he helped rich Chinese clients maintain Canadian permanent-resident status and later obtain citizenship. Chinese passports both real and fake were shipped in bulk to the mainland, where professional forgers would doctor them to make it look like their owners had been present in Canada when they had actually been in China. Wang would set up his clients in fake jobs at his firms, printing business cards for them and issuing pay slips - adding insult to injury, their fake salaries were so low his wealthy clients were able to file tax returns that allowed them to claim from Canadian coffers tax benefits intended for the working poor. ¬† Adding insult to injury, their fake salaries were so low his wealthy clients were able to claim from Canadian coffers tax benefits intended for the working poor Letters from schools and lawyers were also forged, as well as lease agreements. Fake mailing addresses and phone numbers were set up. From 2006 until his arrest in 2014, Wang and his employees at his unlicenced New Can and Wellong immigration consultancies in Richmond are known to have helped 1,200 clients cheat immigration rules. In all, they paid Wang C$10 million (HK$59 million) for his illegal services, the Provincial Court of British Columbia found . Yet the most significant aspect of Wang‚Äôs case is neither the scale of his operation, nor its sophistication and audacity. It is the motivation of his clients. Immigration fraud as the public typically understands it involves various schemes to allow unqualified people to live and work in Canada. Yet, bizarrely, Wang‚Äôs case involved clients willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars to AVOID living in Canada when they were perfectly entitled to do so, having already obtained permanent resident status. Understanding their motivation is key to understanding how Wang found such a steady stream of customers. W"

Only the small handful of news junkies who watch CNN will catch it live - and with America's weekend news audiences often minuscule, especially during the summer, the impact of President Clinton's controversial appearance in Tiananmen Square will have been watered down to a significant degree. By the time Congressmen take to the floor on Monday afternoon to condemn the event, it will already be ancient history.\nDepending on who one believes, this is either an incredible stroke of luck for the White House or a cleverly manipulated piece of timing arranged with the acquiescence of Beijing.\nIt would, as Mr Clinton said, be a breach of protocol not to appear in Tiananmen Square. But, whatever the truth about the timing, this apparent legerdemain of scheduling illustrates the delicate political and diplomatic ballet dances at the heart of a major overseas visit by the US President.\nOn one level, the scores of officials planning such a major event face a mammoth task just dealing with the practicalities of putting together the minute-by-minute jigsaw of the nine-day visit. Their task - to map out with military precision every move of the President, his wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea, accompanying officials, several hundred media, scores of support staff and a handful of VIP delegates - is probably the most tense, nerve-wracking undertaking in the career of many involved.\n'It's an event of unparalleled complexity,' according to Dr David Lampton, a China expert at Washington's School of Advanced International Studies and a member of the team that took president Ronald Reagan to China in 1984.\nBut every bit as complex as arranging planes, booking hotels and choreographing the Secret Service operation is the act of negotiating the political minefield of such a trip. And while China has clearly a lot of domestic and international face to be gained from the first US presidential visit for nearly a decade, it is clear most of the pressure will be on the visitor, President Clinton.\nNotwithstanding the routine Congressional backdrop of criticism of the administration's China policy, the White House believes China's leadership must by now be feeling more secure about Washington's faith in the bilateral relationship. The focus of this summit, from Washington's point of view, will therefore be on educating the US public on China - the country - as well as on the complicated rainbow of China policy issues.\nIt could be a tough task.

From the expansion of the earliest trade routes, the Dutch have built a reputation for establishing successful commercial trading partnerships the world over. This innate ability to develop connections with other trading countries has enabled the Dutch economy to flourish over the centuries. Today, with their world-class shipping expertise, the Dutch continue to show their ability to do business, especially with China. The Netherlands has been one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment since joining the euro zone 10 years ago. The Dutch economy continues to hold its own, despite the present turbulence in the euro zone, through its substantial current account surplus, excellent industrial relations and moderate unemployment. Petroleum refining, food and agriculture, chemicals and electrical machinery all continue to play important roles within the country's economy. As a transportation hub, the Netherlands remains one of the most important in Europe. Bordering the North Sea between Belgium and Germany, the Netherlands is the most densely populated country in the European Union. The relatively small nation has successfully developed trade ties with neighbouring countries and key global markets. Water dominates the Dutch landscape and mor"

The figure climbed 12.9 percent compared to the end of 2010.China-based economists have voiced concerns about the country's debt situation.Bai Jingming, deputy director at the Institute of Fiscal Policy with the Ministry of Finance, said that local governments need to be \"highly vigilant\" against fiscal and financial risks.

Deluxe houses are particularly sought after by a growing number of high-budget tenants looking for top quality  living and superior services, and these premium properties have outperformed the market in terms of rental appreciation, according to Victor Tin Sio-un, assistant general manager of the group's leasing department. For instance, the company's Three Bays project in Stanley has recorded  rental increases of about 45 per cent in the past year. The luxury houses, measuring 3,870 sqft each, are fully occupied and commanding an average rental of about HK$80 per sqft to HK$100 per sqft a month. 'The Three Bays houses offer ample open space to residents,' Mr Tin said. 'They come with large garden and terrace areas, and all the rooms have their own balconies. 'The infinity swimming pool overlooking the sea is another attraction. Tenants simply cannot find comparable properties on the market, and the houses are vigorously in demand.' Costing a monthly rental of about HK$300,000 each, the Three Bays houses have attracted top executives from major financial institutions, insurance companies and consumer products businesses in the Asia-Pacific region. Mr Tin said demand for premium residences  was still on the rise as multinational companies continued to set up and expand their operations in Hong Kong with the prevailing positive economic outlook.

The XKR, a brilliant mix of the top-selling XK8 sports model and the power unit from the amazing XJR8 saloon, is bound to cause a stir wherever it is sold.\nIntroduced at the recent Geneva motor show, the XKR8 offers immense power combined with a chassis and suspension set-up which was sorely in need of extra grunt.\nIt is almost a match made in automotive heaven, and certainly a serious competitor for Porsche's latest 911 or even Jaguar's stablemate, Aston Martin. It will also be considerably less expensive.\nThe Jaguar-designed, Ford-built V8 engine is one of the most compact and probably the lightest in its class. The 'standard' V8 produces 290 bhp at 6,100 rpm, while the supercharged version churns out a mammoth 370 bhp at 6,150 rpm. Torque is up to a massive 387 lb\/ft, produced at the low engine speed of 3,600 rpm.\nIntroduced in 1996 at that year's Geneva show, the V8 was initially installed in the exciting new XK8 coupe and convertible.

Right across the political spectrum, many candidates, both young and old, who had devoted  much of their time  to grass-roots constituency work, were elected as councillors. Most voters were mature and sensible enough to vote for the candidate who had a track record of committed service to constituency residents, although there were one or two exceptions where such did not happen for quite unusual reasons. For the  Legislative Council 'stars' who ran and were defeated in the  election, this trend should serve as a wake-up call, assuming they intend to run  for seats in the Legislative Council next year. For some time,  media reports have been pointing out that the Hong Kong public does not hold the Legislative Council and its members in high esteem, primarily because disorderly antics and language are occurring  too often during Legco proceedings. In the best interests of the community and  Legco, which is Hong Kong's top lawmaking institution, it is time that the president and other  lawmakers took decisive steps to ensure that such unacceptable behaviour will be discontinued. By taking such resolute action, legislative councillors will be applauded for giving due regard to the aspirations of Hong Kong people for a lawmaking institution whose members are capable of and are performing in an orderly manner good and effective governance. Hilton Cheong-Leen, president, Frederick Lynn, chairman, Hong Kong Civic Association Leung is proving more impressive Establishment heavy hitters, Peter Wong Tung-shun, Joseph Yam Chi-kwong, David Li Kwok-po and Allan Zeman  have been batting in an attempt to bolster Henry Tang Ying-yen's bid for the chief executive's job ('Bankers back Tang as next chief executive', November 26).

Housing, education and health are the main concerns of ordinary Hongkongers and  these three areas  will present the greatest challenge to the incoming chief executive in 2012.

But the lower surface area of the fibre limits the absorption capacity. In order to enhance the absorption capacity, some brands use superabsorbent polymers (cross-linked sodium polyacrylate gels). When polymerised acrylate is added to cellulose, the resulting product has enormous ability to absorb water, which has caused an increased use of this substance in the production of hygiene products such as sanitary napkins.\nChandra Shekhar Sharma from the Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Hyderabad and his team turned to nanotechnology to produce cellulose-based nanofibre for use as an absorbent core in sanitary napkins. They chose cellulose acetate biopolymer and subjected it to electrospinning to synthesise fibre of nanoscale size.\nCompared with micron-sized fibre used in commercially available products, the absorption capacity of napkins with nanofibre was higher due to greater surface area a"

But he had an uncle who was a church organist, and he remembers his excitement at 'the bells and smells' of the high church he used to go to with his mother.\n'I always wanted to play the organ: the piano was just the means to the end. The organ is so much the centre of music and the church. Everything seemed to revolve around it.'  Later, he used to get excused from games to practise in the chapel at King's College Cambridge.\n'I used to have to walk through Cambridge on my own when I was quite young. Nowadays no one would allow it.'  I met Mr Preston as he sat at the Cultural Centre organ after a rehearsal with the Hong Kong Philharmonic. He described the instrument - and why he was attracted to it - with a sense of vividness: the magic that entranced him as a little boy is clearly still there.\nThe stops have exotic names - Chamade, Cimber, Dulciana and Bombade, and of course 'Vox Angelica' which is deliberately slightly out of tune, to create an ethereal sense of angels' voices.\nThere are some stops whose subtleties of name have histories of wars and disputes behind them. So 'Trompette' uses a French reed, while 'Trompete' uses a German one, with a slightly harder sound.\n'Two traditions of organ-building have grown over the years,' Mr Preston explained.\nBach's music calls for trompete, while Olivier Messaien would demand the softer cousin, and all good concert organs have to include both.\nMr Preston has played almost all of the world's top instruments: as soloist and choral director he has appeared with most leading orchestras.\nAfter studying at the Royal Academy of Music and at King's College Cambridge, he was appoin"

However, the fact that Beijing failed to obtain an agreed statement in advance from all six parties suggests that the talks will be difficult. After the first round last August, there was no agreed statement, with China trying to put the best face on the situation by saying that all parties had approved another round, perhaps in two months. That was six months ago. In the meantime, the two antagonists - North Korea and the United States - have not moved much from their original positions. The main sticking point is that North Korea is unwilling to discuss what the US calls a covert highly enriched uranium programme. In fact, Pyongyang denies its very existence. If North Korea continues to insist that there is no such programme, then the outlook for the talks is dim indeed. Pyongyang's willingness to freeze its plutonium nuclear facilities at Yongbyon is, of course, a positive sign, one that the US should appreciate rather than spurn.

Such apocalyptic forecasts may yet be fulfilled.

The potential for further unrest remains with student demonstrations at several universities this week.\nThe bloodshed in a Malaysian detention centre shows the potential for such violence to spread beyond Indonesia's frontiers as thousands continue to flee the"

Leung & Co director Terrance Chow said the vacancy rate did not reflect the real situation, and the rate of actual vacancies for prime office buildings was much lower.\nSome space was deliberately left vacant by landlords or investors, who disposed of the properties when opportunities arose, instead of renting them out.\nThe amount of space on the market available for lease was substantially less than what government figures showed, he said.\nThe Rating and Valuation Department forecast that grade-A completions would reach 6.48 million sq ft this year.\nIt said more than 70 per cent of that amount was in non-core districts.

But after 20 years of world-leading economic growth, the prospect of a market of 1.2 billion consumers remains mostly myth.\nThat is not to say wealth creation on the mainland is not taking place at an unprecedented rate. During the years between 1978 and 1996, China's per capita net household income for urban residents increased from 316 yuan to 4,377 yuan, representing indexed growth of 296 per cent. Per capita net household income for rural dwellers rose from 134 yuan to 1,926 yuan over the same period, representing indexed growth of 559 per cent.\nThe result has been a retail explosion, with business volume reaching 2.48 trillion yuan last year, representing 180 per cent growth over the five-year period starting in 1992.\nSharp rises in consumption have created higher ownership rates of consumer durables in most mainland homes. According to a national consumer survey conducted last year by The Gallup Organization, colour television sets are switched on in 88 per cent of urban mainland households, while 82 per cent of city families have plugged in washing machines, and 69 per cent own refrigerators.\nGallup reported that changes in rural lifestyles had been no less profound, with colour television sets present in 36 per cent of countryside households, while washing machines are used in 27 per cent of homes, and refrigerators found at 14 per cent of families.\nCity-dweller and rural resident share one important similarity, the State Statistics Bureau reports. At least half of all disposable household cash income is spent on food.\nGiven the limited discretionary purchasing power of the average family, it is hardly surprising, then, that most multinational consumer product companies continue to target a mainland market whose size ranges from 30 million, the population of China's five largest seaboard cities, to about 100 million or the population of mainland cities with more than one million residents.\nEven within China's urban market segment, however, glaring inconsistencies and differences persist, ranging from food preferences, goods and services available, to spending habits.\nSuch were the findings of last year's CVSC Sofres Media Establishment Survey, which showed, for example, that on the whole urban Chinese families are almost as likely to own a pager as a bathroom.\nIn some cities - such as Fuzhou, Hangzhou and Nanjing - families place priority on owning a private bathroom.

Media reports at the weekend quoted an official from CAO's government-owned parent  in Beijing, China Aviation Oil Holding (CAOH), stating that Mr Chen was no longer in China. But CAO officials in Singapore yesterday said they believed Mr Chen was still in China. 'From what I understand he is still in China,' CAO  spokesman Gerald Woon said. 'We expect him to return.

I would like to offer my deepest condolences to the families of the two firemen killed in the Mong Kok blaze. They were so brave and it is our honour that they were in the disciplined services. It reminds us that all members of Hong Kong's disciplined services risk their lives every day for the sake of  civilians. Hongkongers are very lucky; in fact we are spoiled. So often you read about people complaining about the disciplined services. We do not seem to realise how  things would be a lot worse off without such people. The fatal blaze in Cornwall Court, Mong Kok, shows that it is high time the government started to inspect all  old buildings. It is clear that many old buildings are not suitable for commercial use, such as bars or karaoke lounges above the ground floor. The government should stop issuing licences to all establishments that do no comply with the fire regulations. Johnny Lee Chi-ho, Cheung Sha Wan Should there be more Form Six places for students? It is clear given the number of students trying to get a Form Six place that there is a growing demand. These days, despite the No8 typhoon signal, scores of parents and students waited outside schools to try and get the Form Six places that remained. Students should appreciate that they have a number of other choices if they fail to get into Form Six, such as associate degrees and diplomas. However, young people have misgivings about some of these courses. They are concerned that some employers might not recognise these qualifications.

Oh, and any football phone-in on the radio.\nThe common subject is refereeing. More precisely, refereeing standards and what can be done to improve them or the perception of them.

One wag even dubbed his First Symphony 'The Tenth' (Beethoven had written nine symphonies).\nA few years after his death in 1897, Brahms, along with many other 19th-century composers, was temporarily consigned to the dustbin of musical history. The modernists with their atonal compositions were in the driving seat.\nJan Swafford's comprehensive and absorbing biography shows just how wrong those critics were, and illustrates how much the modernists owe to Brahms' craftsmanship and genius.\nSwafford says: 'His historical image seems to be that of a plodder, an artist who made himself great by sheer hard work. In fact, he was blindingly gifted . . .'  Swafford has clearly warmed to his subject. Although difficult and sometimes downright nasty, Brahms was never boring.\nHe knew all of Europe's greatest composers and virtuosos, and had fractious relationships with many of them.\nParticularly moving was his 40-year friendship with Clara Schumann, which Swafford describes in detail.\nThere are short sections of the book in which Swafford analyses Brahms' most important compositions where an ability to read music is an asset. But for the most part, this is a biography that can be enjoyed by both musicians and laypeople.\nAll Brahms' biographers face a difficult task, because he destroyed most of his personal papers, or at least those he thought might incriminate him. He wanted posterity to judge him from an image of his choosing.\nHe was born in the slums of Hamburg in 1833. His father was a mediocre horn player in a brass band, but he was savvy enough to notice that his eldest son, at age six, had perfect pitch. Young Johannes began composing at age 11.\nAs with most people, his childhood and adolescent experiences had a profound effect on Brahms the adult, and were largely responsible for making him a very mercurial and distant person. Like all young piano virtuosos, he spent hours alone practising. He was deprived of the early relationships, through play, that help us to learn how to be part of our society.

In Korea, Mr Rheingold told Technopedia, the young cyber-generation used the OhMyNews.com website and text messaging to mastermind a campaign that swung the election in favour of  President Roh Moo-hyun.

It‚Äôs Trumpelstillskin and the Emperor-has-no-clothes-on rolled into one. It is not just one lonely voice at the back of the crowd hollering that Trump‚Äôs new policy finery is starting to look less than impressive. There is a much bigger chorus that Trump could fail to deliver on his growth-boosting promises. Investors are beginning to question whether a lame duck presidency is in the offing. Unfortunately for equity market expectations, the cheap money infusion is reaching the end of the line There is a lot at stake. For months, global markets have been pumped full of adrenaline on hopes that Trump‚Äôs tax-cutting, budget-busting reform plans could double US economic growth potential up to 4 per cent per annum, boosting domestic jobs and providing new stimulus for the rest of the world. Judging by equity market price action in the last week, doubts are creeping in with a vengeance. You can hardly blame the markets for all the hype. Overfed on a blow-out diet of low US interest rates and easy cash, Trump‚Äôs promise of an extra big dollop of fiscal stimulus was only going to bloat the market‚Äôs appetite for more risk as"

Is any body still listening?  It is not difficult to be a bear in Hong Kong these days. You will not generate much business, but at least have the comfort of running with the crowd. The trick is less about calling the market up and down, than providing insight into the economic dynamics of a region where old certainties have changed.\nThe Churchouse recantation is interesting if not especially deep.

  "text": "The next roll of the dice\nPUBLISHED : Saturday, 14 March, 1998, 12:00am\nWith an easy chuckle, Stanley Ho confesses to being too nervous to ask President Jiang Zemin for an extension of his Macau casino monopoly. 'I had no courage to talk to him on this issue, to be honest,' he says of a recent private meeting when he 'received' Mr Jiang in one of his hotels in Vancouver.\n'But I will certainly take this up with the new Chief Executive. He must be one of my friends anyway,' he adds, his lean face softening into a slow smile.\nMr Ho has made his fortune by owning gaming rooms, not gambling in them. He has always tried to leave little to chance in an extraordinary career that has ebbed and flowed with the turbulence of the last half century.\nNow, soon to turn 77, he faces uncertainty again. Retirement plans have been put on hold in the run-up to the Macau handover in December next year and expiry of his gaming franchise two years later.\nTriad-linked violence has rocked a Macau already reeling from the regional downturn.\nThe revenues from his privately held franchise - one of the most envied businesses anywhere - have taken a rare hit. His listed Hong Kong firm Shun Tak Holdings is in a slump. Shares limp below the $2 mark after underperforming the stock market from an annual high of $5.75 in October, slashing his net worth. The drastic downturn in tourism has seen even his Jumbo Floating Restaurant in Aberdeen losing money for the first time in 22 years.\nHow this son of a disgraced branch of one of Hong Kong's most powerful families manages the twilight of his career will be of considerable interest.\nAs the challenges loom, Mr Ho does little to play down his role in events with customary confidence. He also speaks of a booming future. 'In 97 the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Government said: 'Stanley Ho, we want you here - you must invest more in Hong Kong. Please stay on and don't retire.'  'Now I receive messages from Beijing and Macau. Please stay on Mr Stanley Ho, don't retire. We need you very much in the transition and even after the transition, so what can I say?  'I think there is nothing to fear,' he said of the coming handover of Macau during a rare interview in the darkened penthouse suite of his Shun Tak Towers office high above Western.\n'It will be the same pattern like in Hong Kong but it will be even smoother . . . there will be no confrontation up to the end because we have no democrats and this question of human rights will not come out.\n'People in Macau, they are less affluent, simple people and easily satisfied. They all believe in this 'one country, two systems' and they believe in the basics.'  When Mr Ho speaks for the Macau people he does so as a most peculiar form of corporate autocrat. Few institutions have a grip on a place like the traditionally secretive Sociedade De Turismo e Diversoes de Macau, more popularly known by the initials STDM.\nThe livelihood of a quarter of Macau's 450,000 people rely directly on its future.\nDirectly employing 20,000 people in its network that includes nine casinos, the Jockey Club, a greyhound track and hotels and nightclubs - it accounts for up to a third of Macau's economy.\nRapid expansion in the past decade has seen it take large chunks of risk in Macau's future through significant shares in the new airport, bridges, a port and golf course, and the massive Nam Van Lakes reclamation set to expand the Macau peninsula by 20 per cent.\nEach year, STDM hands over 30 per cent of its casino revenues to the Macanese government. It is a figure that usually accounts for much more than half the annual budget and one some detractors fear will preserve STDM's stranglehold for years to come. 'There is no other corporate colony like it anywhere,' one Macau observer said. 'It is not healthy.'  The privately-registered Macau company was forged out of a tender in 1962. It brought together Mr Ho with local businessman Henry Fok Ying-tung and the rougher-hewn Yip Hon, the numbers man to run the tables.\nApart from escalating profits, little has changed in 37 years. The company remains largely secretive and Mr Ho is still the biggest shareholder and managing director. His publicly listed Hong Kong development operation Sh"

  "text": "Egypt: ‚ÄòIt pushes you to feel disengaged‚Äô As a boy growing up in a country where football is a national passion, Mina Fayek joined a youth programme at a local sports club in the wealthy Cairo neighbourhood of Heliopolis. He started training, but one day he overheard his coach make an offhand remark: no Christians would join the first team, or make it to the championships. ‚ÄúMy parents and I knew this is not going anywhere, and I had to choose another game,‚Äù Fayek, 26, a software engineer and blogger, recalled. He tried handball and basketball, two sports seen as more acceptable for Egyptian Christians to play. Fayek, an affable young man, believes his social status shielded him from the worst forms of persecution inflicted on poorer Egyptian Christians. Instead, he was subject to a more subtle form of discrimination: the sense that the highest echelons of power and status in his country were off limits because of his religion. During his 13 months of compulsory military service, he trained soldiers and officers in computer skills. As a Coptic Christian, he knew he could never serve in the intelligence branch. No Christians sit on the supreme council of armed forces. ‚ÄúIt pushes you to feel disengaged from your country,‚Äù Fayek said. ‚ÄúHow could someone maintain his love for his country ‚Äì and be passionate about building it ‚Äì while at the same time he can‚Äôt be whatever he wants to be, whether a military commander or a police commander.‚Äù Egypt is home to the largest Christian community in the Middle East, with the Copts widely estimated to be about 10% of the population. The exact figure is a matter of dispute, with the government and Coptic church offering varying estimates. In spite of a history of cooperation between the church and the Egyptian state, Copts today say they face both official discrimination and the threat of violent attacks by militants. Numerous Egyptian Copts participated in the 2011 uprising that removed President Hosni Mubarak from power, and Copts have been targets of violence at key moments in the turbulent years since then. In October 2011, 28 people were killed when the military attacked a crowd of mainly Coptic demonstrators outside the state TV building in Cairo. Sectarian attacks peaked in August 2013 in the wake of state crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood after the removal of the Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi. Crowds of men attacked at least 42 churches across the country in a massive assault blamed on Islamists. The Muslim Brotherhood denied responsibility for the attacks. Egypt‚Äôs president, Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, the former military chief who led Morsi‚Äôs removal, has vowed to fight extremism and launch a new era of religious unity. Many ordinary Copts and the official church are vocal in their support for Sisi. But some Coptic analysts are concerned about both security and the prospects for Copts‚Äô civil rights. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting attacked now by extremists and by security, so in addition to the old-time discrimination in state bodies. It‚Äôs getting worse,‚Äù said Fayek. Jared Malsin in Cairo Pakistan: ‚ÄòWe still stand for our rights‚Äô Anthony Ibraz, a 31-year-old priest in Karachi, preaches tolerance to his flock, contextualising it with the history of persecution, and tries to help unemployed young men shut out of jobs because they are Christian. His own family have suffered because of their faith: hardline neighbours ordered his father to take off the cross he was wearing and beat him up for preaching; his brother was killed by an extortionist targeting the family‚Äôs property, and he grew up hearing about and experiencing discriminatory attitudes at school and from shopkeepers. In Pakistan, persecution is an everyday reality for Christians. ‚ÄúPersecution is not [only] about the blasphemy law,‚Äù said Ibraz at his parish office. ‚ÄúThere are different kinds of persecutions. There is discrimination, when we go out, in education and jobs ‚Ä¶ sometimes slavery in Sindh and Punjab. There are people who come to us who say they are educated and capable but they don‚Äôt get jobs. The reason is religion.‚Äù The persecution of Christians in Pakistan has been driven by m"

Most of the gear you will need - such as a sound mixer and high-quality microphone - can be purchased on a quick trip to Apliu Street in Shamshuipo. The budding podcaster can get started with a modest budget of $1,500. This assumes you already possess other gear to complete your recording studio, such as computer and MP3 player with a line-in jack. The first piece of equipment you will need is a sound mixer, the centre of your 'podcasting rig'. The mixer controls the sound levels of your podcast, such as the input from your microphone. But you can also run audio from a computer to the mixer, enabling you to incorporate music and internet telephone calls into your programme. Sound from the mixer is outputted to the MP3 player, which records the podcast. There are several advantages to this type of set-up. One is it duplicates the set-up of a 'live' radio programme. With music and telephone calls from the PC - along with the host's voice - all going to the mixer, 30 minutes of recording results in 30 minutes of audio. Little to no post-production is required. Another advantage is audio recording takes place on the MP3 player rather than the PC's hard drive. This frees up the computer's processing power for other applications, such as Apple iTunes for managing music or Skype for "

Wangfujing, the Prince's Palace Well, was where Inner Mongolian princes would stay and shop on their visits to the imperial court. The legendary Dr George Morrison of The Times newspaper spent decades living at No 98, a pleasant courtyard house, now long gone.

Negotiations with 33 banks, owed $1.2 billion, and potential investors continue without resolution.\nThe fallout from Mr Wong's great red-chip misadventure has spread far beyond the leading Spirit boardroom. Although holed up his in home town of Jiangmen, Guangdong, High Court writs from margin brokers demanding their money back have piled up.\nMr Wong is reckoned to have borrowed up to $900 million in broker margin financing with the majority of his once 66 per cent stake in the firm pledged as collateral. Shares in the company have been suspended for a month and last traded at a small fraction of their November high.\nWong Shi-ling's was a classic Hong Kong rags to riches story. Local legend has it that as a child he helped his father catch insects to sell at market.\nRaised among a family of nine in Jiangmen he developed a knack for electronics tinkering with appliances before honing his skills in a state factory. A wheeler-dealer by nature, his capital base grew slowly by trading electronic components.\nArriving in Hong Kong in 1987 his big break came when the state factory boss acted as a guarantor for a $300,000 bank loan. Leading Spirit was founded, and today a modern factory has manufacturing capacity for two million television sets, two million VCD players, 100,000 washing machines as well as air conditioners.\nFloated on the Hong Kong exchange in 1993, margins were high, returns on equity acceptable and in June last year the firm reported a net profit of $550 million.\nThe Jiangmen Government provided finance, lauding him as the biggest co"

In fact, cooking is the last thing anyone will expect Kwong to claim an expertise.\nThe former beauty queen-turned-singer and actress has always appeared more at home in glamorous gowns and 10-carat baubles than in an apron brandishing a ladle, but she cheerfully admits that cooking is just one of the benefits of her failed 18-month marriage to actor Ray Lui Leung-wai.\nAlthough she had decided not to talk about the reasons for the divorce, she says of her marriage: 'Before that, there had never been any need for me to cook or learn how to because there was never any incentive. After I got married, I wanted to be a good wife and my ex-husband liked to eat abalone and other dishes, so I learned how to cook those dishes. The interest just grew from there.'  Her efforts to be a good wife saw her practically drop out of sight in the entertainment world as she made few appearances and almost halted her recording work in Taiwan.\nAlthough she was keeping a low profile, the former Miss Hong Kong runner-up kept busy and took four months to finish writing a book on beauty and grooming called Cally Kwong's Book Of Beauty, which offered tips on 'top-to-toe' grooming.\nThe book, which will be published in Taiwan in September, also features forewords by some of Hong Kong's top stars, including Jackie Chan, Jacky Cheung Hok-yau, Andy Lau Tak-wah, Rosamund Kwan Tsz-lam and Alan Tam Wing-lun.\nKwong - whose nickname in the business is 'Mei Yan' or Beauty - laughingly admits she does not know how much the book will be selling for.\n'I just did it because I was interested in the subject. I never gave a thought about the money!' she says, laughing.\nKwong drifted into the entertainment arena 'by chance', when friends persuaded her to sign up for the Miss Hong Kong contest in 1982.\nNot unlike the other beauty queen hopefuls, she drifted into television work after signing up with TVB, and went on to co-host breakfast show Good Morning Hong Kong.\nBut a chance performance revealed that the former public relati"

While spring-summer played up lightness, for autumn-winter 2013, fashion is going dark. Designers proposed a woman of many dissimilitudes, from mid-century ladies to femmes fatales, from punk to grunge queens. But before you start getting the safety pins and beanies out, take note that an element of glamour is still key. These are not for the faint of heart, as designers have turned towards looks with plenty of attitude, perhaps as a communal backlash against the prim minimalism of past seasons. We've scoured the catwalks for the top five trends to watch: ¬† Rebel with a cause Thanks to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Chaos to Couture\" exhibition, punk was on many designers' minds. Although the look means dressing down, there was still a luxe edge thanks to the right details and fabrics. On the catwalks of Versace, Donatella sent out rock chicks dressed in vinyl trousers, and dresses paired with cashmere and fur. Accessories included heavy metal jewels covered in spikes, nails and bolts. Another punk staple - leather jackets - were given a cool street vibe at Junya Watanabe where it appeared mixed with houndstooth and denim. Givenchy and Jean Paul Gaultier's black motorcycle jackets came with plenty of zips. And what's the ultimate punk accessory? Chanel's biker boots draped in chains, naturally. If channelling the Sex Pistols is too extreme, you can always go grunge. The popular movement from the 1990s was the starting point of Hedi Slimane's collection at Saint Laurent. His version, however, was way more glamorous. Courtney Love wannabes will revel in styles including vintage floral and embellished baby-doll dresses, covered up with slouchy cardigans and tartan flannel shirts. Models even wore diamant√©-studded tights. ¬† Mid-century couture For couture, designers referenced everything from Dior's New Look to film noir and Alfred Hitchcock.

The scandal began, as so many scandals in China now do, on the internet, as Web users subjected Yan's reports to scrutiny and the allegations were followed up by her employer. Yan has now become something of a sensation  in the Chinese Web world.  Internet users have compiled the whole series of  reports she wrote using her own relatives as her chief  sources, and Yan has been dubbed China's 'greatest journalist', a title obviously granted in jest. Faking news stories is of course not  new, but Yan's case is certainly  exceptional.  Thanks to the efforts of internet users, her habitual use of her own family members as source material  was laid out  for all to see,  and the overall effect is comical. But the scandal should  also get us thinking. According to Xinhua and many Web users,  Yan's conduct stems from poor professional ethics and a lack of regard for media credibility. The work of the journalist is largely the work of conscience. Those who aren't interested in the public's right to know or in social justice would do best to stay clear of this profession. And yet, as it happens, our profession is full of the crooked and the shifty. It's only that many journalists are more clever than Yan  in concealing their crimes. Much of the anger being vented over Yan's conduct is actually the product of festering frustration over the quality of news coverage in our country.

All of the data on the drive would be lost, which was a serious setback if one had not diligently backed up files. Total data loss is still a risk today, even though the latest operating system, Mac OS X, rarely crashes. The biggest causes are defective or low-quality hard drives. The tried-and-true solution is still to back up data regularly to media that can be stored offsite from the main computer. I find, based on my experience working for a small publishing company, that the most common data losses come from people who are in an editing frenzy and not from hard-drive crashes. Here are common examples: Employee No 1 opens proposal A, and edits it for another client. Six months later, he wants to   know if I have a copy of the original proposal. Employee No 2 deletes all her e-mails regularly after two months, on the assumption that I keep copies on the server. This is fine - until she requires a year-old e-mail that ended up being a contract for a price, according to the customer. Employee No 3 creates a new database from what she thought was a copy. When she deleted what she thought was another copy, it turned out it was the only version of the file. Employee No 4 gets fired; she downloads a Zip disk full of client information and deletes those files on the company's server before she leaves, assuming the company will back up the modified version. Employee No 4 also copies and de"

It has an owner, \"Ah Yeh\"; its \"cage\" is the \"one country, two systems\" framework; and the birds are being allowed to be taken on a \"walk\" towards universal suffrage. This is not total freedom, since Hong Kong birds do not have full autonomy to fly around by themselves.

The year of 2011 is a \"Central European year\" in the sense that Hungary and Poland take the helm of the EU presidency successively, Martonyi said. \"If both presidencies are successful,then clearly the message will be that Central Europe is mature.\"    One priority of the Hungarian presidency is to continue the European Council debate on six legislative proposals submitted by the European Commission, covering budgetary discipline, economic supervision, cooperation, crisis management and strengthening institutions respectively. An amendment to the Lisbon Treaty is also planned to enable their implementation.    \"Our primary job for the rotating presidency, is to foster these six proposals so that all the legislations can be adopted by the end of our presidency,\" Martonyi said.    Hungary has been strongly promoting the integration of the western Balkan countries, beginning with Croatia into the EU. Martonyi said he believed there is a \"fair chance\" of negotiations with Croatia being concluded by the end of the half-year Hungarian presidency with signing of documents done under the Polish presidency.

At the more artistically driven end of the Hong Kong film industry, directors such as Wong Kar-wai  can spend four years making a single film. But To, who is a proven hit maker and pursued by every film company in town, juggles two or three films at the same time. This revered filmmaker is so busy he was unable to collect the best director prize bestowed on him at the recent Hong Kong Film Awards for PTU or to jump on stage when another of his films, Running on Karma, picked up prizes for best film, best actor and best script. Of course, working on more than one film at the same time is common practice in Hong Kong and unavoidable due to the demands of release windows and the  crowded schedules of the major stars. But not every film  To directs is made this way. Some of his more personal projects, such as PTU, are filmed  between commercial movies and can take months or even years to complete. But mainstream films need big stars and are usually released during the peak holiday seasons - Christmas,  the Lunar New Year and summer. Now that the mercury is starting to rise, the pressure is on to get the major summer movies in the can. To's next movie - the detective thriller Breaking News - has already wrapped but will probably open slightly later than initially expected in July.

There was also support for a plan by  the owner and operator of  Hong Kong's stock exchange to introduce new yuan products, although several observers said that could be difficult to achieve since the currency is not yet freely convertible. HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia  unveiled the exchange's three-year strategic plan last week. Objectives include creating alliances with mainland and overseas exchanges in the next three years that would benefit its mainland focus. It also plans to introduce yuan investment products, such as index funds or derivatives for the currency, and  measures to attract more international firms to list in the city. 'HKEx will position itself as a market of choice for mainland investors to invest in and for mainland issuers to raise funds,' Li said. 'We will also attract more new listings from the mainland and from international firms in Hong Kong.' Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen,  the chief executive of Principal International (Asia),  supported the plan. 'I think it is a good idea to form alliances with the mainland bourse. Hong Kong is becoming an important component of the Chinese financial services sector and stronger ties can only add more value,' Auyeung said.

While the strategy of buying into the Shanghai exchange‚Äôs top 50 blue chips has paid off handsomely, investors now face a difficult question: whether to stick with it or head for the exit? Even though the trade is looking long in the tooth by some measures, analysts say there are some good reasons why it will continue for the medium term. Among them, a recently imposed rule designed to restrict substantial shareholders from a rapid unwind of their holdings in listed companies may actually help extend the rally in blue chips, in spite of its intention to boost demand for equities broadly. ‚ÄúLiquidity is the key,‚Äô‚Äô said Ken Chen, a strategist at KGI Securities. ‚ÄúIt remains unknown when the deleveraging will come to an end and the tight liquidity situation will be reversed so investors still have nowhere to put their money but the large-caps for now.‚Äô‚Äô Funding costs have been surging in China‚Äôs financial markets, with yields on 10-year government bonds rising to an almost two-year high and inter-bank lending costs even exceeding the benchmark lending rate, as regulators increase scrutiny of wealth management products and inter-bank lending activities to reduce financial leverage.

Naturally, they wanted to talk to him about freedom of speech in Hong Kong, a topic about which Cheng now finds himself an expert. A month ago he publicly lambasted Secretary for Education and Manpower Joseph Wong Wing-ping for refusing to appear on his new television programme, Hong Kong Affairs. As Cheng has a reputation for savaging his guests mercilessly, Wong's reluctance to be disembowelled on air was understandable but he does seem to be a particularly sensitive flower for a politician.\nHe demanded an apology for Cheng's scathing remarks concerning his absence, and ATV's acting chief executive, Kenneth Kwok Wai-kin, complied, referring to Cheng's 'unintentional mistake'.\n'The next day I said on air that I deliberately did it,' remarked Cheng with glee. 'I'm not responsible for that apology.' Hence the interest by the foreign media. So what did he say to CNN? 'I said the Government is closing in on us, they don't like talk shows.' Which is fine, but Cheng's very existence is surely proof that there is freedom of speech. How does he feel about providing the Government with a ready-made, here's-one-I-prepared-earlier example of its wonderful leniency in such matters? 'You mean as a tool?' said Cheng, thoughtfully. 'Yes, I've become a tool. But now I cut their fingers. And we're getting too sharp for them. I raise hell.' Let me tell you now, interviewing someone who is famous for being a rude interviewer is a liberating experience. Aside from the fact that Cheng was a charming lunch companion ('I'm a different person on air'), it was a safe bet that he wasn't going to storm off in a huff if I tried to catch him out on various matters.\nLet us contemplate one of the most pea-brained notions ever to be given mileage in newsprint, which was the plan espoused by Cheng and others in summer, 1989, to re-establish Hong Kong on the northern coast of Australia.

There has been much talk on what should be done on the harbourfront, how the Star Ferry clock tower and now Queen's Pier may be moved around like objects. The government is keen on public feedback on these as well as issues relating to the Tamar site. Had there been more focus on the opportunities the reclamation could bring to the existing city in response to its natural growth, the priorities may become more obvious. Regarding heritage, preserving a sense of place is sometimes as important if not more so than preserving old buildings. Look at the Sun Yat-sen trail in Sheung Wan. The stepped streets give us a sense of place and our linkage to the past, even when all the old buildings are gone. If the streets are no longer there, all would be lost. Together with City Hall and the old Star Ferry building, Queen's Pier has given us a memorable sense of place. If relocated elsewhere, the significance of these structures will be greatly diminished, leaving City Hall to face onto 'Edinburgh' (no longer a Place), which is to be bound by a  road. Re-erecting Queen's Pier and the frontal mass and clock tower of the Star Ferry in their original, or slightly adjusted locations would not only be the best way to preserve our heritage, but also give us the opportunity to expand our city in a meaningful way. Lying on an axis with the old Star Ferry building, Statue Square was our historical town square on the waterfront before later reclamations. The city has since outgrown this square, which logically should also have become bigger by now. By removing the existing car park block (that should not have been there in the first place), the substantial increase of this central open space can turn it into a new city square, defined at the southern end by HSBC Building  and  opposite  by the reconstructed Star Ferry block with its set relationship with the reconstructed Queen's Pier and City Hall, and flanked on the sides by heritage, cultural, and new and old commercial buildings.

Photos: Cecilie Gamst Berg; Corbis; AFP David Beckham helps point the way to a toilet in Sanya. The view from the Zhujiang Crystal Hotel, in Wuzhishan. An exhibit at the \"nationalities\" museum in Wuzhishan shows a member of an ethnic minority getting help sowing her skins together. \"Warm prompt: Beware of falling objects!\" says the sign in the toilet of carriage seven of the Harbin-Haikou train. Showing a picture of a Rolex watch, it is a gentle reminder not to drop your stuff into the toilet. \"Oh, China!\" I laugh indulgently as I snap a photo of yet another wonderful Chinglish-ism. A couple of hours and three beers later I do not laugh quite so loudly when my camera, in its pack, drops from my belt, hits the floor with a sickening thud and bounces into that toilet. \"Ha ha! What, did you have to pick it up and clean it off? Yuck. LOL,\" will say the few people I'll be able to tell this story to when I return from a 10-day tour of Hainan Island. These people, though, clearly aren't familiar with long-distance Chinese trains. If they were, they would know that on such a train, the toilets are the squatting type only, and that there is no U-bend from which someone who's not too fastidious can fish out a Rolex watch, say, or a camera. No, it's the ground, disappearing beneath you at 90km\/h, taking your watch (or camera) with it forever. That's why the train builders put up the sign; not for my amusement. Is this how our much-awaited trip to the tropical paradise of Hainan will be? Ever since we almost froze to death in Guizhou province last Christmas, my travel companion, Andrew, has sworn: \"China trip good, but no more cold. Only tropical paradise from now on.\" And Hainan, only a 14-hour train ride from Guangzhou, seemed to fit the ticket. The photos on the travel websites showed nothing but white sandy beaches and palm trees. To me it looked quite boring, but we could always take day trips into the mountains. \"Unless they're too chilly,\" Andrew added. But there is no sign of anything tropical when we get to Haikou, the capital of Hainan, which is its own province and (of course) special economic zone. The traffic is unbearable, with incessant honking, pedestrians are made to walk up and down endless steps just to cross the street and it is ‚Ä¶ freezing. Not Harbin freezing, but thick jacket-and-scarf-freezing. Where are the beaches? Thank God I have packed according to my pessimism and not the official tourism photos. ¬† I CHAT WITH THE HOUSEKEEPING lady before entering my hotel room and I like to think she can clearly see, or at least hear, that I am a woman. However, as soon as I close the door and put my bags down I see two business cards advertising the sweetness and purity of scantily clad Ling-Ling (or Ding-Dong, I can't recall), being pushed under the door. That night, we happen upon a street of big, garage-like rooms, open to the elements but for shopfront grilles pulled down, so they resemble cages. Bathed in pink fluorescent light, gaggles of women with button-popping cleavages, fishnet stockings and skirts the size of belts sit perched on plastic stools, huddled together for warmth. If so cold, why not wear something? \"That is the same kind of light they use in Hong Kong markets to make meat look better,\" Andrew remarks. Unlike other brothels I've seen in mainland cities, these don't even bother to pretend they are hairdressing salons. There is no hairspray, no scissors, not even mirrors. Just women on stools, shivering behind bars. Maybe the no-mirror thing is a Hainan idiosyncrasy, though, for when we reach Dongfang, a coastal town four hours' bus ride from Haikou, we find that the bathrooms - two in each room, as we have splashed out on 268 yuan (HK$340) \"special luxury\" accommodation - also have no mirrors. However, here the cards from the ladies of the night, three this time, have been tastefully displayed in the ashtray, near which a helpful sign says: \"Warm prompt: Stop smoking\". If I was in any doubt, a note on the inside of the door reassures me that \"The pornography, gambling and drug abuse is strictly preserved\". Because Hainan is a tropical paradise, no hotel (we check) bothers with carpets. This must look good on paper; economical, hygienic and what not (I've seen some grubby carpets in my time, what with grooves from burning cigarette ends, chewing gum and other stuff that no vacuum cleaner can pick up) but, though well-appointed, the rooms look sad, bare and cheap without floor covering. Sub-white and shiny like the corridors in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, they are just too clinical, too morgue-like, for a hotel room. The night is so cold I have to sleep in long socks, trousers, jumper a"

No comment on the planned launch was immediately available from Beijing‚Äôs foreign ministry. Seoul‚Äôs foreign ministry said in a statement that the move was a ‚Äúgrave provocation‚Äù. Japan‚Äôs Kyodo news agency said Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda had ordered ministries to be on alert for the launch. ‚ÄúNorth Korea wants to tell China that it is an independent state by staging the rocket launch and it wants to see if the Unite"

  "text": "Health and wellness The best tips for fighting chronic inflammation ‚Äì a nutritious diet is a good start Chronic inflammation has been linked to serious conditions, from cancer and cardiovascular disease to allergies and arthritis, but healthy lifestyle habits can help keep this destructive problem at bay PUBLISHED : Thursday, 16 November, 2017, 7:18pm Experts grade new tools to fight phone addiction: Apple vs Google 17 Jun 2018 Inflammation sounds far from pleasant, but it‚Äôs completely normal, and in fact, an essential part of the body‚Äôs attempt to heal itself. When you are injured, sick, or develop an infection, for instance, an inflammatory response is triggered and your immune system kicks in to try to repair the affected tissues or protect your body from foreign substances such as bacteria and fungi. Why it‚Äôs never too late to start working out, as gym granny shows ‚Äì just pick the exercise you like and take it from there During this important natural process, you may experience specific symptoms such as pain, warmth, redness, swelling and loss of function (for example, movement, hearing or smell). Without this complex biological response, wounds and damage to the body would not heal. While acute inflammation is short-term, with symptoms subsiding after a few days, the same cannot be said for chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation occurs when your immune system just can‚Äôt seem to ‚Äúshut off‚Äù, putting your body on ‚Äúhigh alert‚Äù and creating a prolonged inflammatory response. According to Sara Jefferson, a naturopath at Dr Susan Jamieson Integrative Medical Practice in Hong Kong‚Äôs Central district, inflammation becomes a problem when there are too many stimuli, such as in some infections where the body is overwhelmed with bacteria. In some cases, such as with autoimmune diseases, the protective immune process goes awry and begins to attack healthy tissue, causing damage, and this can lead to more inflammation. Chronic, systemic inflammation is a worry because it is also thought to contribute to the development or progression of certain long-term conditions, such diabetes and cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression, rheumatoid arthritis and allergies. Indeed, numerous studies over the years support this association. For instance, a study published in 2016 in The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry revealed that people with depression had 46 per cent higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a strong biomarker of inflammation, in their blood samples (note: the study only managed to establish a connection between inflammation and depression but not causation). Another study, published in 2016 in the journal Cell Reports discovered a link between inflammation and an increased risk of prostate cancer. The researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles found a previously unrecognised type of progenitor cell in uncommonly high numbers in inflamed areas of the prostate (the cells are rare in other parts of the prostate).

Earlier, after some insurgent groups aired warnings against the election and threatened to wreck the event, spokesman of the Baghdad Operation Command Qassim Atta said the Iraqi security forces have beefed up security for polling stations in Baghdad.The quiet morning was soon broken as a spate of mortar barrages and rockets struck different areas of the city, while we were still on our way.

In a television interview, Cubbon said he was not worried about a bubble in the luxury residential market: 'Like the modern art market - paying  $5 million for an Andy Warhol painting is not a bubble. Maybe it is, but it is such a tiny portion of the market.' Then, later in the same interview, he lamented Swire's missing out on a golden opportunity to expand in that market. 'You could say it was our strategic mistake,' he said. 'Perhaps we could have taken more time to look at opportunities in Hong Kong ... I believe it is sensible to deploy more people and capital to the Hong Kong business.' In the last five years, Swire has been expanding aggressively on the mainland, sinking more than HK$10 billion into four projects in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. As Swire Pacific finance director at the time, Cubbon must have known which projects would yield the company a better return. Cubbon compared his business with playing in a premier league against other well-capitalised teams, adding, 'we can't guarantee who the champion will be this year'.

When they deglamourise, it is news. I put the question to Swara Bhaskar, a competent actor who has been trying to find her way to the top creative echelons of the industry for some time. However, when she can play the so-called urban girl-next-door with ease, she is expected to do glossy stuff?\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve always assumed that the bigger the star the bigger the news really!

The city was the first to separate state enterprise administrative and business operations through the formation of state-owned group-holding companies.\nShanghai also unhesitatingly applied the policy of 'grasping' large and viable state firms, while 'releasing' smaller and less competitive companies to market forces. The result has been an unprecedented wave of state-sector mergers, acquisitions and bankruptcies.\nThe human cost of restructuring, however, has been nothing less than staggering. In the past five years, state firms have shed more about 1.2 million jobs, or one-third of the 3.6 million state posts that existed in 1990.\nThis year alone, the municipality's state-owned sector is expected to contract by a further 250,000 positions.\nFinding work for more than 80 per cent of those left 'off-post' or unemployed has been one of the most ambitious undertakings of the municipal government.\nThat work began in 1994, when Shanghai was selected by the State Council as one of 18 pilot cities to begin experimenting with re-employment schemes.\nMunicipal leaders responded by establishing a co-ordinating group - two vice-mayors, three Communist Party vice-general secretaries and the municipal "

The May 17 celebration is to honour the day when our constitution was proclaimed during the short-lived attempt at independence in 1814.\nReal independence only came in 1905, but the 1814 constitution, much inspired by the ideas of the French and American revolutions, became a rallying point for our independence movement in the 19th century.\nBeing a young nation, we have always put great emphasis on stressing our national heritage. May 17 has also traditionally been a special day for the children of Norway, when they flock into the streets under their school banners and Norwegian flags and march past the local city hall, or as in Oslo, the Royal family on the balcony of the royal castle.\nNorway and Hong Kong are far apart and may seem very different, Norway being 300 times the size of Hong Kong and having only 4.4 million people. Yet there are many bonds and similarities. And in this age of globalisation and frequent travel, geographical distance does not represent the same barrier as before.\nShipping has always been a major link. Norwegian ships have been active in the China trade for more than 100 years. Shanghai and later Hong Kong became important ports of call for Norwegian ships. We still have more than 200 Norwegian ships calling at Hong Kong every year and our maritime service industry is we"

While the Asian financial crisis is undoubtedly the worst thing to have hit Hong Kong since July 1, 1997, it has the effect of drawing the SAR closer to its motherland.\nOverall, Beijing has every reason to be happy with the way things have turned out since President Jiang Zemin pronounced the end of 150 years of 'colonial humiliation' at the Convention and Exhibition Centre.\nFor if, in the run-up to the handover, Hong Kong citizens were eager about erecting barriers against 'interference' from Beijing, a radically different mind-set reigns today.\nThe 'mainland market' and other prospects of doing business north of the Shenzhen River are seen in many quarters as the only way that Hong Kong can lift itself out of the recession.\nHong Kong was grateful when Beijing agreed recently to allow more mainland tourists to the SAR. Until the tourism and allied trades went into a tailspin, one of the biggest fears of SAR citizens was of an influx of mainlanders into Hong Kong.\nJittery investors in Hong Kong are hoping that, in his speech marking the first anniversary of the resumption of sovereignty, President Jiang will give reassurances that the SAR can count on China to tide it over the difficulties.\nWhile announcing his $44 billion boost for the economy last month, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa cited as one reason for optimism 'the strong economic development in the mainland as [the SAR's] back-up'.\nEconomic integration between the SAR and the motherland has taken a leap forward. Questions that concern the mainland, such as the attainability of eight per cent GDP growth this year, have as much relevance for the Zhongnanhai party and government headquarters as for the movers and shakers in Hong Kong's Central district.\nPerhaps not coincidentally, the SAR has been swept by a wave of patriotism. In the wake of the now-famous 'confession' by Chief Secretary for Administration Anson Chan Fang On-sang of her nationalistic pride on seeing the Chinese flag being hoisted last July 1, other public figures have professe"

So we need to be very careful how we prioritise its use. There are three uses which stand out: housing, employment and recreation. Housing is a priority because men moved out of caves centuries ago and now dwell in purpose-built structures that provide shelter from the elements. In Hong Kong's circumstances, that means high-rise apartment blocks for most. Today, thousands of families live in buildings designed for industrial purposes or are crammed into small residential flats that they are forced to share with other families. Moreover, many of the flats occupied by single families are too small. This is demeaning. The aim should be to house every nuclear family in an apartment of at least 50 square metres. Without economic activity, we would all go hungry. In a service economy like Hong Kong (well over 90 per cent of our gross domestic product), that means mostly offices, plus hotels to accommodate visiting businesspeople and tourists. Very few traditional manufacturing industries can thrive in such an environment, so all but a handful of niche activities will get squeezed out. Agriculture and mariculture are pretty much lost causes, too. Sufficient space for r"

Virtually all those present at what is informally known as 'morning prayers' are staff from the Chief Executive's office.\nUntil recently, the only outsider invited to attend was the Central Policy Unit (CPU) chief, Gordon Siu Kwing-chue.

Nor is this the only evidence of Mr Siu's close working relationship with his boss.\nFew policy secretaries have any complaints about their access to Mr Tung.

In the past four months, she has had audiences on their feet and eating out of her tiny hands from Taiwan's Kaohsiung to Hong Kong and Singapore.\nSome might attribute her heightened popularity to Canto-queen Faye Wong's retreat to play house with husband Dao Wei and baby in Beijing. However, Singapore promoters are still raving about the most enthusiastic response to a concert for years. 'Not even Faye, Andy [Lau] or Sammi [Cheng],' could compare, says one. Tickets for her March concerts in Hong Kong and May shows in Singapore sold out within hours.\nHer name? Sherry Cheng Huei-mei or A-mei ('little sister') to her friends and fans. She does not belong to the Faye Wong school of style, nor is she particularly gorgeous. In fact, she looks like she desperately needs a new hairstylist and perhaps - as my teenage niece suggests - to 'update' her wardrobe a little. But charm and energy she has by the truckload.\nAs one Singaporean fan's tribute posted on a website devoted to her declared: 'What can I say, man? Chinese Pop has finally found its diva!! A-Mei's vocals are definitely unique and totally in a league of her own.'  While her two albums (Sisters and Bad Boy) are selling more than a million copies each, even in these days of rampant piracy, her live performances are what have sealed Cheng's reputation as queen.

For instance, he ordered that no Hindu should ride a palanquin, an Arab horse or an elephant without permission. However, Aurangzeb was shrewd enough to realise that he could not apply these restrictions to the Rajputs or other martial communities whose services the Mughals could not do without. And so the Rajputs and other Hindu clans who were on the payroll of the Mughal army were exempt from these regulations. In Aurangzeb‚Äôs eyes, the Shias were as good as infidels but he did not allow his prejudice to interfere with political expediency.\nWhen an amir complained to him about the prominent role played by the Shia Persians in the court, the wily Aurangzeb rebuked him saying that ‚Äúreligion had no place in worldly affairs.‚Äù But it was the Jizya that became the most dramatic and blatantly racist expression of Aurangzeb‚Äôs anti-Hindu policies. The Jizya was abolished by Akbar in 1564, but on April 12, 1679, Aurangzeb reimposed it.

It discusses the country's global interests and objectives. It also presents the actions taken to implement the national security strategy and counter any security threats.\nThis is the second report on the national security strategy issued during Obama's tenure, with the first one published in 2010. From both reports, we can see that the United States has been concerned about the rise of China, in particular its military modernization, and it is determined to influence the direction of China's development. Judging from the two reports, America's understanding of China's strategy has undergone a number of changes.\nFirst, the United States is more concerned about the risk of Sino-US conflict. The 2010 report stressed that it is \"ready\" to ensure that the interests of the US as well as its regional and global allies will not be adversely affected by China's military modernization. At the same time the 2015 report makes it clear that despite obvious competition, the US does not consider that \"confrontation is inevitable\".\nSecond, the US is directing more attention to bilateral cooperation. The 2010 report said that the two countries cannot agree on every issue, but the divergences should not prevent both sides from cooperating on matters of common interest.

She took in the designer's best Prive Fall 2007 Coutour collection yet, a controlled, savvy ode to wearable chic of the tony sort. Though Armani cited David Bowie as his inspiration, he kept the references so well in check that, save for the occasional spangled fedora, big holographic buckle closures and some glam-rocky colors, one could easily have missed the connection. And that was wise indeed, as Armani thus avoided the silliness such a theme might trigger. The lone caveat: his finale, a trio of gowns with bizarre molded elliptical skirts. If he was aiming for Space Oddity, well, he hit the mark. Still, Armani should be excused that bit of overwrought theatricality. After all, this is couture. And no disrespect to Bowie, the actual inspirations here were real women Blanchett and those who would resemble her - who covet chic, flattering clothes. Armani packed his lineup with plenty.

He would wake up, read the newspaper and exercise in his spacious 3,000-square-foot home in Kowloon Tong where he lives with his wife, one of several women in his life.\nInvigorated after a light workout, the 83-year-old would toil for long hours every day, often inviting his business associates to come to his office in the Lai Sun Commercial Centre in Cheung Sha Wan on a Sunday for meetings, and working through holidays such as Lunar New Year. He commuted once or twice a month to Taiwan, and travelled frequently to the mainland.\nWhen in Hong Kong, he preferred to travel in a chauffeured American car rather than an European status symbol like a Rolls-Royce or Mercedes. He never ate a meal at home because, some say, he feared being poisoned.\nBut the head of Lai Sun Group, which includes five listed groups with a combined market value of $8 billion, has a somewhat different routine these days. Forced to relocate to Taiwan, where he is awaiting the outcome of bribery charges levelled against him last week, Lim may never see his comfortable Hong Kong home again.\nFortunately for Lim, he is not behind bars; these days, while on bail, he is still allowed to live in his second home and to go to the office of his Taiwan subsidiary Dollar Textile, where he has given media interviews and stoutly denied the charges against him. His prison sojourn in December lasted less than a month, and he was allowed to run his companies from his cell in the Taipei Detention Centre.\nBut the old-timer must be cursing his seemingly hopeless situation. In the autumn of his life and in spite of all his wealth and connections, he is facing a possible seven years in prison.\nHis alleged crime is now well known. He is accused of bribing Chuang Yu-kun, a former director of the Taipei County Government Land Administration Bureau, who stands accused of pocketing millions of US dollars. It is alleged that in exchange the bureau, then headed by Chuang, re-zoned land owned by Lim in Sanhsai, Taipei County. Fourteen other defendants were also allegedly connected.\nLim's problems in Taiwan are not the only reason he is making headlines. Last week he confirmed he was selling part of the 67.5 per cent stake he, his family and companies hold in ATV, the station he took over 10 years ago as chairman and later chief executive. Cheng Yu-tong's New World Group owns 27.5 per cent and casino tycoon Stanley Ho the other five per cent.\nThe identities of the members of a consortium who are rumoured to be buying Lim's stake remain a mystery.\nThe future sale of Lim's stake in ATV, more than the criminal charges against him, has sparked animated debate in Hong Kong because the station is considered a media institution in the realm of the general public, more than his other business wheelings and dealings have ever been.\nATV was originally called RTV, for Rediffusion Television, a British-owned operation that was incorporated as a private company and granted a licence in 1973. Shortly after rival TVB was set up in 1967, RTV had to shut down to switch to wireless broadcasting from cable lines.\nBy the time RTV completed the transformation and was up and running again, it had inadvertently given TVB a head start"

Banking sources said the move by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (Safe) was part of efforts to monitor and manage money inflows that could destabilise the economy.

In a casual meeting you would - if you remembered him at all - place him as an auditor, a tax accountant or a dentist.\nCharlie Chan did not feel the same way. Charlie Chan was the author of a number of letters sent under this fictional name to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the stock exchange and press in 1994 alleging Mr Yuen was an insider dealer and had been trading in a company of which he was a director.\nThe scandal made headlines for weeks. The allegations were denied and went no further.\nThe Commercial Crime Bureau also felt sufficiently passionate about the apparently anonymous Mr Yuen to raid his home the same month in search of evidence he was mounting an illegal bid to take over insurance company National Mutual. The allegations were denied and went no further.\nAdd to this the fact that Mr Yuen was the youngest and one of the most controversial chief executives of the stock exchange in Hong Kong history, had blazing rows with local brokers - at one point allegedly calling them 'illiterate' - and clashed with the newly formed SFC.\nMore famously, he took Wardley's entire dealing team from under the nose of arch-comprador Willy Purves to an American competitor. Now you begin to see that appearances do, in fact, get you every time.\nThe five-year-old Francis Yuen who arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai was concerned primarily about the fact he had never seen his father before. Mr Yuen's father was a seaman and spent most of his time overseas.\nAfter the Communists seized power in the mainland, Mr Yuen and his family were able to emigrate to Hong Kong as his father had been out of China at the time of the revolution.\nLeaving behind what Mr Yuen described as a 'very grand house' he ended up - as did members of so many families at that time - living in a 100-square-foot room with five other people and three other families in the same house. In this environment, family relationships were sacrificed to more pressing requirements - earning money.\n'Being a refugee, you have to be ready to work harder than more established people. That gives you a more competitive spirit - an instinct for survival.\n'I only saw my father for the first time when I was five. In all my life I have only probably spent a couple of years with him.'  Did he regret not having the opportunity to get to know his father better?  'I won't say regret but it is something that I resented a bit. Obviously he worked very hard to keep the family so, actually, I - you know, you know, resented it a bit, you know.\n'My father passed away 1992 or '93, so I, you know, I wish I had more time to keep him company.\n'But I found my childhood very happy.'  Put it down to hard work, the refugee spirit or plain brains, Mr Yuen excelled academically, eventually obtaining an economics degree from the University of Chicago and beginning a PhD at Rochester - before returning to Hong Kong to work at the Chinese University after finding his doctorate 'boring' and 'abstracted'.\nAn advertisement that appeared in newspapers seeking hot new talent to be trained at Wardley - the merchant banking arm of Hongkong Bank - promised to be a lot less abstract and a lot less dull.\nHe spent the next seven years immersed in the Hongkong Bank culture, eventually being made head of corporate finance - at that time the most senior position held by a local Chinese person in the HSBC Group.\nHis future at the group seemed assured, but Mr Anonymous once again belied his stodgy image, leaving in spectacular circumstances, joining upstart United States bank Citicorp and taking his team with him - a move which rumour has it left then Wardley chairman Willy Purves spluttering over his scotch.\n'At the time,' Mr Yuen said with gleeful "

In fact, in the geographical constituencies you'll probably see almost nothing but familiar faces.\nOf the 20 directly elected legislators, at least 19 are likely to be former members of the provisional legislature or the pre-handover Legislative Council.

In the Election Committee, most successful candidates are expected to be former members of the provisional legislature.\nMany reasons have been given for the popular apathy towards the May 24 polls, and no doubt a number of factors are at work.

The authorities are proposing to build huge sluice gates to control the flow of water from the river into the country‚Äôs two largest freshwater lakes ‚Äì Poyang in Jiangxi province and Dongting in Hunan province. The barriers will stop Yangtze finless porpoises from travelling between the river and the lakes for food and shelter they need, according to Xie Ping, a researcher at the Institute of Hydrobiology in Wuhan in Hubei province. Animals trapped in the lakes for long periods, however, would struggle to mate and reproduce, he said. Porpoises belong to the same family of aquatic mammals as dolphins and whales. Baiji dolphins also used to live on the Yangtze River, but scientists believe they finally became extinct a decade ago. Can these three steps save the Chinese white dolphin in Hong Kong? The need for the water control measures has been prompted by the construction of the Three Gorges Dam higher up the Yangtze River. It has led water levels to fall further downstream and water to flow out of the lakes and towards the sea. This has already had a huge impact on communities living in t"

The price fetched at Tuesday's government auction surpassed - on a cost-per-square-foot basis - that of the choicest pieces of real estate in New York and London. But this does not mean the sale is entirely a cause for celebration. The price paid  is a striking example of how much the super-rich are prepared to spend  to set up home here. It says something positive about Hong Kong's attractiveness.   This can be seen as a welcome antidote to all the talk in recent times of our city losing its edge. However, though the price paid is staggering, the sale will not have an impact on the non-luxury  property market. Indeed, it is an indication that the gap has widened between the top end of the market and the bottom - and that is worrying. Hong Kong is  known to be a city of extremes. But even those who believe in the so-called trickle-down theory should be concerned that the wealth of those at the top  is not filtering down fast enough to benefit people who are struggling to make a decent living. While the post-1997 recession is  behind us and incomes have climbed slowly  in the past few years"

  "text": "The US and China have shrugged off rules and constraints that have kept their 21st-century global rivalry in check, opening the way for an escalating conflict on many fronts that neither side appears willing or able to stop. Chinese officials have accused Washington of starting a new cold war, but the jostling between the two powers has already shown its potential to turn hot through accident or miscalculation, if action is not taken to defuse tensions. Within the past few weeks, as a trade war loomed between the two countries, US and Chinese warships came within yards of colliding in the South China Sea. And the FBI set a trap in Belgium for a senior Chinese intelligence official and had him extradited to the US, provoking fury in Beijing. Washington has meanwhile significantly ramped up its bellicose rhetoric portraying China as a dangerous adversary. In a UN security council meeting last month Donald Trump accused Beijing ‚Äì without citing evidence ‚Äì of seeking to oust him through interference in US elections. A few days later, his vice-president, Mike Pence, expanded on the accusation, saying China was pursuing a ‚Äúwhole-of-government approach‚Äù including ‚Äúcoercive‚Äù methods to interfere in US domestic politics to bring to power ‚Äúa different US president‚Äù. Pence, like the president, did not supply evidence for the claim. Most experts said that China ‚Äì though a leader in economic espionage that has sought to lobby against Trump‚Äôs tariff policies ‚Äì was not trying to hack the US elections in the way Russia had meddled in the 2016 vote that brought Trump to Oval Office. But the Chinese government has ended a cyber ceasefire agreed between the president, Xi Jinping, and Barack Obama in 2015, unleashing armies of hackers once more in pursuit of the trade secrets of US firms. And Beijing has ordered its navy to use more far aggressive tactics to stop US and allied ships sailing near islands and reefs in the South China Sea it has claimed and turned into military outposts in order to assert control of strategic sea lanes. The 2015 Xi-Obama cyber ceasefire did not halt cyber espionage by any means, but it did lead to a drastic reduction in the wholesale theft of intellectual property by the Chinese state for the competitive benefit of Chinese industry. That truce is now well and truly over, according to Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder of the CrowdStrike cybersecurity firm. ‚ÄúCrowdStrike can now confirm that China is back (after a big drop-off in activity in 2016) to being the predominant nation-state intrusion threat in terms of volume of activity against Western industry,‚Äù Alperovitch said on Twitter. ‚ÄúA few months after the September 2015 Obama-Xi agreement, we witnessed about 90% drop in Chinese nation-state sponsored intrusions against Western co"

Like many others in Hong Kong, the group general manager of Chow Sang Sang Holdings is feeling the brunt of a sluggish economy and a tepid retail environment. To make matters worse, the government's Sars relief package offers little reprieve for his businesses. The Informer  spoke with him recently about work, diamonds and the theatre. Q: Jewellery and securities are very different businesses. Why does Chow Sang Sang operate both? A: My family, led by my grandfather, started the jewellery business in the 1930s  - we are one of the longest established jewellery groups in Hong Kong. The company operates 80 shops in the Greater China Region. The group only stepped into the securities business in 1975, at a time when gold was a very popular investment. Many investors traded in gold via our securities arm. So there was a close link between jewellery and investment companies. The investment market has changed a lot in the intervening decades. Gold is no longer a popular investment product so our securities firm now mainly trades stocks. Q: In light of the weak stock market, will you keep the securities business going? A: We will keep it.

The trend toward multi-polarity and economic globalization is gaining momentum, and the international security situation, in general, continues to tend toward relaxation. Relations among big powers are complicated, with many interwoven contradictions and frictions. However, drawing on each other's strength, cooperating with and checking and constraining each other remain a basic feature of their relationship. The vast number of developing countries, with great potential for growth, are an important force in promoting the establishment of a fair and reasonable new international order, and in safeguarding world peace and development. Science and technology are making progress with each passing day, and economic ties between countries have become ever stronger. Economic development, scientific and technological innovation, and the growth of aggregate national strength remain the priorities for many countries. Worldwide, the forces for peace are prevailing over the forces for war. A new world war will not break out for a fairly long time to come. The security situation in the Asia-Pacific region has been on the whole stable. Many Asian countries, particularly the East Asian countries, have tided over the financial crisis and their economies are steadily recovering with bright prospects. It is the policy options of most countries to rejuvenate their economies, and enhance dialogue and cooperation. They will continue to develop state-to-state relations in accordance with such principles as sovereign equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. A number of countries have consistently stood for peaceful settlement of disputes, and engaged themselves in security dialogues in a variety of forms, at different levels and through different channels. All this has helped enhance mutual understanding and trust. The cooperation among ASEAN, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea (10+3) is steadily developing in the economic and financial field. The tense situation on the Korean Peninsula is markedly easing off. China and Viet Nam have signed a land border treaty. The situation in the South China Sea remains generally stable.However, in today's world, factors that may cause instability and uncertainty have markedly increased. The world is far from peaceful. There is a serious disequilibrium in the relative strength of countries. No fundamental change has been made in the old, unfair and irrational international political and economic order. Hegemonism and power politics still exist and are developing further in the international political, economic and security spheres. Certain big powers are pursuing \"neo-interventionism,\" \"neo-gunboat policy\" and neo-economic colonialism, which are seriously damaging th"

Leading the pack are the United States'  nuclear-powered 'supercarriers'. At the other end of the spectrum is the Thai Royal Navy's helicopter carrier, which is never fully armed and rarely put to sea. Now  the mainland is planning to build one of its own. Details of  the mainland's first aircraft carrier have been subject to intense speculation since Beijing confirmed its intention to build one. Most analysts believe it will be similar to the former Soviet Union's unfinished Varyag,  bought by China from a Ukrainian shipyard through a Macau tourism company in 1998. Varyag was of the same class as Russia's only aircraft carrier - the Admiral Kuznetsov,  Andrei Chang,  editor-in-chief of the Canada-based Kanwa Asian Defence Monthly, said. 'The first Chinese aircraft carrier will be of medium size with more than 60,000 tonnes of full displacement, loaded with 24 Su-33-type folding-wing fighter jets and more than 20 anti-submarine helicopters,' Mr Chang, who has monitored China's carrier project for more than 10 years, said. As on the Admiral Kuznetsov, the 16,700-square-metre flight deck on the  carrier  would feature a final section angled upwards at 12 degrees to assist takeoff, he said. Four arrestor wires would be fixed on the other side of the deck to help landings by 26-tonne fighter jets such as the Su-33. A Shanghai-based military expert, who has visited one of  the mainland's aircraft carrier production shipyards, said the carrier would be gas-turbine driven with a displacement of 65,000 tonnes.

The aim is to protect unzoned enclaves in the city's country parks from development that is out of character. First, at Tei Tong Tsai on Lantau Island near Ngong Ping, the government resumed ownership after the owners began building funeral urn niches in breach of a lease.

For the amateur or indecisive home owner, a contemporary ambience is the way to go. According to Stephen Chan Wai-ming,  design manager of inX Design,  this design works for almost anyone and is simple enough to pull off. The style is clean, simple, with little or no unnecessary detail, and is usually created with modern (hence, easy-to-source) materials. Mr Chan said the style's monotone appeal allowed for flexibility with regard to existing furniture. As adaptable as this style can be, however, there are still those with a more specific look or purpose in mind when it comes to designing their home.

The three challenges included recognition of children as full individuals, protecting children and ensuring their full rights according to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and universal registration of newborns, said Jean Zermatten, Vice-Chairman of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. People always neglected the rights of children and thought children should obey adults. But now they must change their conception and recognize that children were not products or articles owned by adults, parents, communities or states, Zermatten said. \"A child is a full person and born with rights,\" he said, and it was a very big challenge for society to recognize and accept this new concept.

Under the agreement, the deadline for abolishing tariffs on dozens of textile products traded between the US and Mexico will be brought forward to August 1 this year from July next year.\nATMI director of trade Cha"

As a long-term resident in Hong Kong, I sent both my children to local schools from age three to age nine and eight respectively. At this point, it was sadly obvious that they were not able to learn efficiently in a totally Chinese environment. After lengthy discussion with their school, we decided to move them (individually) to the ESF system. Their time spent at a local school was invaluable in helping them learn Cantonese, but with no home Chinese support and only a few hours each evening with a tutor, it was clear they could not function fully in a Chinese environment. I do not enjoy paying the ESF fees. I would choose a free or subsidised English-speaking school if a place were available. However, they are not. To cap this, our son has just completed university, which we do not believe would have been possible had he been in a totally Chinese learning environment for his entire schooling. This is said in no disrespect to local schooling, which we greatly appreciated. As an English-speaking household, we simply could not provide the home support our children needed to flourish academically. Sharon Chandler, Lamma Some jobs are bad for planet It was pleasing to  read that company prospectuses and reports in Hong Kong no longer have to be distributed as hard copies ('Printers face hard times as reports go online', December 6). This will be a great benefit to  the environment. According to Green Sense, prospectuses  used up the equivalent of  more than 15,000 trees in 2006. This a waste of raw materials  and it contributes to global warming by reducing the amount of CO{-2} absorbed by trees. However, the suggestion that this new measure is bad news for  printing firms  serves to highlight a well-understood  fact: that, in Hong Kong and indeed all over the world, many people make  a living by deliberately destroying the environment. There are any number of examples - manufacturers  making goods with built-in obsolescence; shops and restaurants  with excessive  lighting and air conditioning; fishermen who trawl for critically depleted  stocks; office staff who make  unnecessary photocopies just to  look busy, and individuals who drive alone in big cars just for their own convenience or 'face'. These  activities are an assault on our environment, and these people  should be seen for what they are - public enemies. It is understandable that workers should try to protect their jobs, but governments also have a responsibility to help them find less destructive ways to make their living. One simple truth which is still ignored by most Hong Kong residents is that"

He reminds commentators that 'candidates' purpose is to win a seat, not engage in an intellectual discussion; the logic of winning votes is different from that of conducting a rational analysis'.\nAs in past elections, he says, the 1998 poll is political; it is about asking the candidates to state their stance towards the powers that be. Voters know the councillors do not govern and do not have the constitutional powers to change the Government's policy direction; all they can do is to represent 'public opinion' to 'strive' for improvements.\nLee Kim-wai, however, feels the poll atmosphere is dull and the turnout rate likely to be low primarily because neither China nor Britain is intervening. 'Behind the contest between the patriotic and democratic camps in the 1995 election was a struggle between two political forces - China and Britain,' she said in her column in Ming Pao. The atmosphere surrounding the last election was rich because both sides tried their best to mobilise supporters; but this was not the norm, she said.\nTo Fan Chung-lau, the most disappointing aspect is the performance of candidates in the functional constituencies.\nWriting in the Hong Kong Economic Journal, he says professionals have long projected an image of independence and autonomy, and acted as society's 'conscience'.

According to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC), it would appear that the communist party is determined to deter reporting on the massacre of demonstrators that occurred on 4-5 June 1989. Foreign journalists and their local staffs have been summoned by public security officers to their offices to be given video-taped lectures dissuading them from reporting on the anniversary. Some reporters were warned of serious consequences should they disobey the authorities. The FCCC, in calling for a halt to interference, argues that the authorities are violating Chinese government rules governing foreign correspondents that permit them to interview anybody who consents to be interviewed. The Beijing-based organisation, which represents 122 news organisations from 29 countries, has catalogued several examples of harassment. The tank man pictures: too 'sensitive' to report A French broadcaster told of showing people on a Beijing street the iconic photo of the student who stood in front of a tank during the military crackdown on 5 June 1989 and attempting to interview them. Within 10 minutes police showed up and ordered the French team into a police car and took them to police station. After an hour, public security officers arrived and interrogated them. She said: \"They separated us and questioned us for hours... The officer said, 'You were speaking about a sensitive topic. You know that the topic is sensitive and the government don't want people to speak about it.' \"I asked which Chinese law I broke. He answered, 'It's not a matter of law. It's a matter of culture. The culture is above the law.'\" The team were released after six hours of interrogation. The next day they were questioned again and then had to appear before a video camera and admit they had done something \"very sensitive\" which could cause \"disturbance\". A reporter working for a north American media outlet was called to the (police) entry and exit bureau and told that security would be especially strict during the \"sensitive period\" in \"sensitive areas\".

The first thing a person notices about another person is the attitude. If the attitude  is good,  the impression he gets will also be good. The first impression is the last impression, so if a person shows a positive attitude in the first place, he will always be the centre of attraction.  But if the attitude is negative,  he will be isolated from other people and society. To achieve something good,  you should have positive thinking.  A person with a negative attitude will never go forward in  life. Raj Kumar, California  School How I miss my childhood When I was five,  I lived with my grandparents for a few months in Shanghai. They were teachers  at a secondary school. They loved to  take a walk after dinner and always took me  along. A lot of women  were selling balloons. Every time I saw them, I  wanted   a balloon. My grandparents always bought one for me.  They loved to hug me and see me smile. Sometimes I really want to go back to my childhood and enjoy  life with my grandparents. Chan Ling, Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College Work hard, but play hard too I am writing to express my opinion on the educational views of Asians. Parents,  especially those in Hong Kong, put all their efforts into supporting their children in pursuing knowledge, such as sending them to  universities. They believe acquiring more knowledge and getting  a master's degree is the only way out in today's  society. Hence, tens of thousands of Hong Kong teens toil day and night studying  at the expense of leisure.   However,  there's always something more besides studying, for example, playing. Not only does playing give you  a break from studying, but also "

And there are hopes that the anniversary will go some way to restoring the bond between people who have had more than their fair share of differences over the years - the Lee family. Let bygones be bygones. It feels so much better if you let it go ... We share the same family name after all Bruce Lee's elder sister Phoebe The opening of the biggest ever museum exhibition devoted to Bruce's life and work yesterday brought Bruce's elder sister Phoebe and nephew Clarence - the son of Bruce's younger brother Robert - face to face with Bruce's daughter Shannon. It's rare for Bruce's siblings to share a stage with his daughter or his widow, Linda Lee Cadwell. The two sides of the family have often pursued projects devoted to Bruce separately. What little communication there has been has more often come in the form of e-mail exchanges and letters from lawyers, rather than heartwarming phone calls and family gatherings. \"Let bygones be bygones,\" Phoebe, 74, said on the eve of the opening of the exhibition at the Heritage Museum in Sha Tin. \"It feels so much better if you let it go ... We share the same family name after all.\" The division in the Lee family is no secret. Distance (most live in different parts of the United States) is one reason. Cultural differences also come into play, with Lee's siblings forming a traditional Chinese family. Shannon and Cadwell, who has remarried twice since Bruce's death, are all-American. \"We are not on bad terms,\" Shannon said. \"We just don't communicate very often.\" But Robert, speaking from the US, has a different take. \"I wish Bruce wasn't that famous in that respect,\" he said. \"We could have a real, complete family.\" At the crux of the family feud are the lucrative rights to Bruce's name, image and work. The controversy has been reignited by the Bruce Lee: Kung Fu, Art, Life exhibition, which opens to the public today and runs for five years. Robert said his side of the family has been shunned by organisers after they got in touch with the Bruce Lee Foundation, a charity headed by Shannon and Cadwell. \"Three years ago, the museum approached me and Phoebe on the exhibition,\" Robert recalled, describing a lunch with Leisure and Cultural Services Department officials in San Francisco. He said he and Phoebe even proposed installing a replica of their childhood home at 218 Nathan Road from the set of the 2010 biopic Bruce Lee, My Brother, for which Robert served as an executive producer. The museum liked the suggestion. But he said: \"We didn't hear anything from them. We didn't know what was going on.\" He later realised the museum had teamed up with Shannon for the exhibition, in which more than 400 out of the 600 exhibits come from the foundation's collection. Sources say the government museum simply wanted to stay out of family affairs. But the handling of the matter certainly upset Robert, Phoebe and their sister Agnes, who demanded the museum remove the film set just one month ago, saying they owned the intellectual property rights. Rights issues have become an unshakable problem for the Lee family since Bruce's death from acute cerebral edema. Records of the office of the secretary of state of California show that in 1985, Cadwell, Lee's late son Brandon and Shannon made claims as successor-ininterest to the rights of a deceased personality under California code Section 3344.1. The code offers protection of the rights to a person \"whose name, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness has comme"

But, as unusual and scandalous as the revelations about Liu's mafia-style operations are, of even greater significance is the identity of the political protectors behind him. In China, violent crime is usually crude and the tools of the trade unsophisticated. In Liu's case, police apparently seized advanced and strictly controlled weapons and ammunition. The acquisition of such weaponry suggests Liu was no ordinary criminal, but one with superior power and connections. According to accounts now emerging, Liu's criminal operations went on unencumbered on a huge scale for the best part of two decades. Such longevity shows the success of the alliance he built between politics and business, and suggests that there must have been a high-level patron protecting him. That person is widely believed to be Zhou Yongkang, the former security tsar who Xi Jinping has prioritised in his anti-corruption campaign, following the fall of Bo Xilai. It is not coincidental that Liu established his politics-crime-business connections during Zhou's time as provincial secretary of Sichuan. Casting around for political patrons, Liu allegedly first hooked Zhou's eldest son with a massive investment deal. The release of evidence showing a direct connection between Liu an"

The West's intention of forcing China to loosen its control on the export of rare earths is no secret.

His field trips yielded some horror stories. One of the worst was a roast pork bun, or char siu bao, maker who put an open toilet in the middle of the meat and bun preparation area because he  did not like his workers sneaking off for 10-minute  breaks.

E-commerce travel companies Ctrip and eLong have built internet portals, combining them with traditional telephone sales, to tap the  growing domestic travel market. Both firms have tapped western capital markets to fund  expansion. Last year, eLong arranged more than one million nights in hotels through its own channels and sold 81,000 airline tickets - a relatively new service - in  the third quarter of this year. While electronic ticketing systems are standard practice in the west, they are new to China, where ticket sales have been controlled by the major airlines and hotel rooms  are usually co-ordinated through the national tourist agency. Instead, either by telephone or online, eLong arranges discount hotel rooms and airline seats.  In future, it will buy inventory in advance, like western travel consolidators do, at cut-rate prices.  There should be plenty of room for eLong to grow. ELong chalked up 60.1 million yuan in revenue in the first half of  this year, compared with 74.4 million for all of last year. That was due to a 65 per cent year-on-year  increase in hotel room bookings and a nearly 200 per cent rise in air ticket sales. Investors have been big fans.

  "text": "Pressure rises in Xinjiang's melting pot\nPUBLISHED : Saturday, 23 May, 1998, 12:00am\nIt is late Saturday evening in a square in the centre of Urumqi. On one side is a mosque, on the other a cinema and recreation area where locals play chess and fish in a fountain. And in the middle, underground, there is a disco with expensive equipment but few clients.\nIt is a fitting image for the complex mix of cultures and religions, Han and Muslim, that is Xinjiang, China's largest region. In its far west, with one sixth of its total land area and bordering eight countries, some want to make Xinjiang a separate country.\nIn the Urumqi square you hear a mix of views that sums up the province's contradictions. 'I studied medicine but have gone into business instead so I can make money and go abroad,' said a young Uighur man standing outside the mosque. 'The Chinese Government does not like Islam. If you are a devout Muslim, you will not be promoted.'  Collecting the tickets at the cinema was a Han Chinese from Henan province who arrived here with the army in the 1960s and stayed on.\nWas the city tense after bombs exploded on two buses and killed two people in February last year? 'Yes, it did cause tension for a while but did not affect normal life. People continued to take buses. There are terrorists in all countries. There is only a small group of people doing this.'  He had lost contact with his family in Henan and Urumqi was his home now. Could he speak Uighur? Just one or two words, he said with an embarrassed smile.\nThese two men are from the two major communities in Xinjiang, which between them account for 85 per cent of its 17 million people - Uighur 47 per cent, and Han 38 per cent. The remaining 15 per cent comprises 46 other minorities. In 1949, Han accounted for only two to three per cent.\nFor the Central Government, Xinjiang presents, with Tibet, the greatest challenge to its ability to manage its minorities and maintain its borders. In both, a part of the population wants independence, or greater autonomy than Beijing is willing to give.\nNo foreign government supports the independence movement of either and their chances of success seem negligible, short of a Soviet-style collapse of the Chinese state. Unlike Tibet, led in exile by the charismatic Dalai Lama, Xinjiang's independence movement is fragmented and has no known leader.\nSince the collapse of the neighbouring Soviet Union, it has turned violent, with bombings and ethnic violence last year in several cities and more incidents this year.\nBeijing's strategy is the same in both places - military crackdown and economic development, pouring in billions of yuan to win the hearts and minds of the people and persuade them they have a better economic future in a unified China than in an independent Tibet or Uighuristan.\nThis investment aims to draw both into the Chinese mainstream, by popularising the use of Putonghua, promoting local officials, and linking the places' economies with those of the rest of China. Official figures suggest violence in Xinjiang is minor, compared to independence struggles in other countries. During 1997, fewer than 100 people were sentenced for terrorist acts.\nIn Yining, close to the border with Kazakhstan, in the most serious incident reported in the mainland media, at least 10 died and 140 were injured during two days of ethnic r"

The Paris-based body, which advises industrial oil-consuming nations, also forecast China would overtake the US as the world's biggest oil consumer \"in the early 2030s\". Growth in oil demand to 2040 would also be driven by India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, the IEA said. Consumption in developed economies would shrink, with oil use in the US falling to the lowest level in decades, it said. Overall global energy demand would grow 37 per cent by 2040, with fossil fuels key to meeting that increased demand despite concerns about global warming. The IEA warned global energy security was at risk as \"reliance grows on a relatively small number of producers\". It noted that the Middle East \"remains the only large so"

Nine women and six men have been confirmed dead in the stampede in an entrance tunnel on the way to the event site, and more than 100 people were injured, 45 of them seriously, Duisburg police said. (Xinhua)    The death toll from a stampede on Saturday at a music festival in western Germany's Duisburg city has risen to 18, with 16 people confirmed killed on the scene and two others succumbing to injuries in hospital, local police said.    The previous toll was 15. There were also 80 others injured, 45 of them seriously, as a crowd of thousands was blocked inside a tunnel and a mass panic occurred during the Love Parade, a popular electronic music festival, according to Duisburg police.    The police said at a press conference that the stampede happened shortly after 5 p.m. local time, as people were pushing and crushing each other in an entrance tunnel leading to the event 's main stage.    Police said that some people were killed and hurt after \" climbing over the barriers and falling to the ground.\"    Local police have opened a hotline to help contact the relatives of the victims.

It has a vacancy rate of 90 percent seven years after it was built. (File photo, August 2010) Liu Bin \/ for China Daily    Despite high vacancy rates and concerns over property tax, prices continue to tempt buyers looking for a good return on their expenditure, Yu Ran reports in Shanghai.    Dong Zhenxing was pondering what to do with the villa he has owned for more than two years but has never lived in.    The two-story property in Anting New Town in Shanghai's Jiading district sits next to the Shanghai International Circuit, home to the Formula One Chinese Grand Prix, and has been empty since he bought it in 2008.    \"I'm not like those housing speculators,\" said Dong, a trading company owner who exports electronic appliances manufactured in Kunshan, Jiangsu province, and whose annual income is about 10 million yuan ($1.52 million).    \"I don't think I will buy another villa for the moment because a trial property tax is being brought in and you have to spend too long waiting for a good return on the investment.\"    Finally, the 55-year-old shrugged and announced he would decorate the two-story villa and move his family in next year if prices don't rise enough to yield what he regards as a healthy profit.    Dong is not alone in sitting on an empty property and wondering what government policies might do to its value.    Villas have become especially attractive to speculators who have become used to making a quick buck from a market that seemed to be forever on an upward trajectory.    The authorities see things differently. They are more keen on ensuring the stability and affordability of house prices.    The central government announced in September it would impose a trial property tax in some cities, and the taxes went into effect Jan 28 in Shanghai and Chongqing. And Beijing on Wednesday announced rules that include a limit of two properties for people with city residence permits, and one property for eligible non-locals.    China's real estate market remains overheated, even after a slew of tightening measures last year, including higher down payments, higher lending rates for second-home buyers and two increases in the benchmark lending rate.    Chongqing will tax all villas as well as new apartments that cost at least twice the average price of all newly built homes in the southwestern city.    All newly bought additional homes of permanent residents in Shanghai will be taxed if the average floor space for each family member in all the properties added together is more than 60 square meters, the Shanghai municipal government said.    All new homes bought by non-permanent residents will also be taxed, but the buyers can get the money back for their first new homes after they have lived and worked in Shanghai for three years.    \"The levy is designed to help regulate the property market and to keep house purchases at a reasonable level,\" said Shao Minghao, head of research at Shanghai Hanyu Property Consulting Co Ltd. \"It will definitely affect the villa market eventually.\"    Shao said fewer villas will be sold because they tend to be more expensive than apartments and therefore will attract more tax. As a result, a real estate bubble might be averted.    The authorities determine whether a home is vacant by measuring how much electricity and water are used. It is very di"

Legco briefing paper June 2003 HOW SAD, all to no avail. The directors of the Eastern Harbour Crossing just would not pay any heed to their social obligations, you see, and insisted on taking their case for higher tolls to arbitration. They have now won that case. The result is that, instead of paying $5 more per crossing, as the company earlier proposed, motorists will now have to pay $10 more. Surely we can sympathise with a government spokesman who lamented on Friday that: 'We are very disappointed at the outcome of the arbitration and are extremely concerned about the toll increase.' Sympathise if you will. I do not. What we have here is a government that tried to pander to populist causes by reneging on an explicit agreement and was very properly stopped by arbitrators who came to exactly the same conclusion that previous arbitrators had done.

  "text": "Disappointing eurozone manufacturing surveys combined with a number of other factors to send markets sliding, despite a positive report from the US. China was more uncertain, with the PMI survey better than some had feared but only showing tentative growth. On the geopolitical front there were worries about the possible repercussions of US air strikes on Syria. Pharmaceutical shares came under pressure after the US announced new plans to crack down on tax inversion, where US companies snap up overseas businesses and relocate their head offices abroad to pay less tax. The likes of AstraZeneca and Shire have been targeted in this way. In the UK, the FTSE 100 suffered its biggest one day fall since 3 March, for all the above reasons and with the added factor of a weak supermarket sector after poor growth figures from the latest Kantar Worldpanel survey. So the closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 97.55 points or 1.44% at 6676.08 Germany‚Äôs Dax was down 1.58% at 9595.03 France‚Äôs Cac closed 1.87% at 4359.35 Italy‚Äôs FTSE MIB fell 1.56% to 20,351.03 Spain‚Äôs Ibex ended down 1.33% at 10,801.8 In the US, the falls are more limited, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 38 points or 0.22%. On that note, it‚Äôs time to shut up shop for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we‚Äôll be back tomorrow. Back again to the meeting between the Greek prime minister and German chancellor in Berlin. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Today‚Äôs talks in Berlin were billed as yet another turning point in the crisis that has preoccupied Europe since exploding in Athens in late 2009. Although his fifth tete a tete with Angela Merkel, this was the first time that Antonis Samaras could impress upon her, in no uncertain terms, the fiscal progress Greece had made. And, racheting up the pressure to end one of the hardest phases of modern Greek history, impress upon her he did. Greece, he said, had not only outperformed fiscal targets -- pulling off a primary surplus, returning to capital markets two years earlier than expected, improving its international competitiveness and recapitalizing its banks - it had begun to emerge from six harsh years of recession. Finally, the debt-stricken country could ‚Äústand on its own feet‚Äù without the help of its troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. ‚ÄúGreece will soon propose it‚Äôs own framework of reforms for the coming years after the memorandum,‚Äù the leader insisted in what will go down as his first public attempt to define Athens‚Äôpost-bailout era Greece, he told reporters after the meeting, was now so keen to end its dependency on outsiders it would seek to conclude financial aid from the International Monetary Fund early. ‚ÄúI believe that this process will ‚Ä¶ come to an end, actually before the timeframe originally envisaged,‚Äù said Samaras adding that Athens in no way required a third bailout to cover a looming financial gap in 2015. ‚ÄúWe want normalcy for our country and we have showed that we can attain credibility.‚Äù Although rescue funds from the EU and ECB had been due to end this year, aid disbursements from the IMF had been slated to continue through March 2016. In a departure from times of yore, Merkel also appeared unusually conciliatory, praising Samaras for his leadership and confirming that Athens was making headway. ‚ÄúI know what difficult times Greece has gone through. But the first tender shoots of success are visible,‚Äù she said, emphasizing that Germany, the biggest contributor of rescue funds to date, was always ready to support the eurozone‚Äôs weakest link. But while Samaras clearly won his bid to buy time - and understanding - ahead of all-important presidential elections (which could in turn define the political landscape early next year), the meeting was as important for what was not said. The all-important topic of a write down on Greece‚Äôs debt load ‚Äì at 175% of GDP unsustainable by any account ‚Äì was kept firmly off the agenda. Much will now depend on the course of the troika‚Äôs next review of the economy. Denying that international auditors will delay their forthcoming inspection tour, the finance ministry announced that finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis would meet troika representatives in Athens on September 30. A rise in US interest rates could come in the first quarter of 2015, according to St Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard. Bullard - who is a non-voting member of the Fed - made the remarks at a banking conference, repeating his earlier predictions. There was much talk about whether the phrase ‚Äúconsiderable time‚Äù would be removed from the last Federal Reserve statement about the timing of a rate rise. In the event the words were kept in, and Bullard said he backed that decision. Meanwhile Bullard said the Fed should change the way it communicated its views on the future path of interest rates, according to Reuters. He said: I would like to get the commitment to move to something more data dependent. I think that‚Äôs really the way to go. And here‚Äôs a good comparison of the various PMIs from today, courtesy Markit: More detail from the Richmond Fed report: Overall, manufacturing conditions strengthened in September. The composite index for manufacturing moved to a reading of 14 following last month‚Äôs reading of 12. The index for shipments edged up one point, ending at 11, while the index for new orders also gained one point, finishing at a reading of 14. Producers remained positive about business conditions for the six months ahead. They expected solid growth in shipments and in the volume of new orders. The indexes for expected shipments and new orders ended at readings of 41 and 37, respectively, slightly below their outlook of a month ago. The US manufacturing sector expanded again in September, matching the previous month‚Äôs growth rate, according to data firm Markit. The initial reading for its purchasing managers index for manufacturing was unchanged from August‚Äôs figure of 57.9, the highest since April 2010. Markit‚Äôs Chris Williamson said: The flash PMI signaled another month of impressive growth of the US manufacturing economy. The third quarter as a whole has seen the strongest expansion since the sector began to recover from the financial crisis. We expect GDP to grow at an annualised rate of at least 3% and as much as 4% depending to a large extent on how the vast services economy fared in September. Meanwhile the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond‚Äôs monthly manufacturing index for September rose from 12 in August to 14. This sign of strength in the US economy means the market, while down, is doing better than had been expected in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is off 12 points, compared to forecasts of a decline of up to 50 points. That has helped European markets come off their worst levels, with the FTSE 100 now down 85 points, Germany‚Äôs Dax dropping 98 points and France‚Äôs Cac around 70 points lower. A quick catch-up. European stock markets are down sharply today, after weaker than expected surveys of private sector activity . The FTSE 100 is sharing in the selloff, down over 100 points. Details at 1.38pm BST The selloff was triggered by the latest data from Markit, which monitors activity at thousands of firms in Europe, and beyond. Markit‚Äôs composite PMI index fell to a nine-month low, indicating that European business activity is growing at the weakest level this year. Details at 9.15am. France was, once again, the eurozone laggard, with its service and manufacturing sectors both shrinking and losing jobs again. Markit says the French economy continues to weaken. The German data was mixed - service sector firms grew faster, but factory output slowed. Analysts say that the poor data has fuelled concerns over Europe‚Äôs economy. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: ‚ÄúSome weaker European economic data and a resumption of geopolitical concerns following the Syrian air strikes are dampening sentiment. ‚ÄúIn addition, recent profit warnings from the likes of Tesco and Tate &amp; Lyle and concerns that future merger and acquisition activity may be crimped by the US authorities attempt to crack down on tax inversion are completing a stultifying cocktail. ‚ÄúAlthough presently difficult to see, the better than expected Chinese manufacturing data overnight and upbeat expectations for the impending third quarter reporting season are amongst the strands of optimism to which the bulls are currently clinging.‚Äù The UK stock market was also hit by the US clampdown on tax inversion, announced overnight, with several pharmaceutical firms including AstraZeneca dropping. In other news... Economists have warned that the UK government is on track to miss its deficit reduction targets. The latest public finance data, released this morning, showed that Britain borrowed slightly more this August than a year ago. Full story: George Osborne likely to miss deficit reduction target as UK borrowing rises Tesco‚Äôs share price has slipped below the 200p level for the first time in eleven years, as the crisis over its profit overstatement continues. Details. Over in Berlin, German chancellor Angela Merkal and Greek PM Antonis Samaras have been meeting. Merkel said there are ‚Äúpositive signs‚Äù from Greece, while Samaras repeated his pledge that Greece will post a primary budget surplus (ie, excluding debt payments) this year. And Greek cleaning workers have been holding a protest rally in Athens, as they push to get their jobs back. Photos here. And I‚Äôm now handing over to Nick Fletcher. Thanks all. GW The Wall Street Journal also attributes the sharp falls on Europe‚Äôs stock markets today on the slowdown in eurozone growth, and America‚Äôs clampdown on tax inversion. Tommy Stubbington writes: The weak data and setback for Europe‚Äôs prospects for takeovers are a ‚Äúperfect combination‚Äù to put stocks under pressure, according to Fran√ßois Savary, who oversees around $10 billion of assets as chief investment officer at Swiss bank Reyl. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt count on M&amp;A activity then you have to look back at fundamentals. Today‚Äôs data shows the recovery will be only gradual which will have an impact on people‚Äôs earnings expectations,‚Äù he said. The eurozone data are likely to put further pressure on the European Central Bank to come up with fresh stimulus measures to prop up the flagging recovery. ECB President Mario Draghi signaled Monday that the central bank remains open to aprogram of quantitative easing if inflation stays too low. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs too much bad news the prospect of more from the ECB isn‚Äôt enough to hold up markets. We already had a lot of QE optimism in the price,‚Äù said Christian Stocker, an equity analyst at UniCredit. The FTSE 100‚Äôs 120 point slide means it is on track for its first triple-digit fall since early March. There‚Äôs still time to recover, though. Trading ends at 4.30pm. European stock markets"

But  consumers are fully aware of what they are getting and are free  to buy it or reject it.  What is perhaps more disturbing is that as a dominant theme, sadomasochism seems to permeate many of its cartoons for children, as it does with some of the country's higher literature and popular entertainment. Because this is implicit,  it carries a subliminal message that is not immediately detectable and so all the more insidious. I have no idea what effects this may have on children who, according to Freud at least, are born polyamorously perverse. I ordinarily wouldn't worry too much about this but for the fact that so many of these cartoons end up being extremely popular with local children. My own children, all under seven, have recently become addicted to the Keroro cartoon series, about a group of fun-loving frog-like aliens from outer space who come to destroy humanity and take over the planet but keep forgetting their primary mission because they have been having so much fun on Earth.

It's Mahatma Gandhi's former home in Paldi, a suburb of Ahmedabad, in Gujarat state, west India. Gandhi opened the ashram a century ago, in 1915, when Paldi was little more than a tiny, snake-infested village, on his return from South Africa, where the \"Great Soul\" worked as a legal adviser. Today the 22-guest ashram is included in Maroon Migrates' \"Live Like Gandhi for a While\" holiday. So it's a holiday destination? Yes.

Or so Chinese medicine would have you believe. Snakes have been a Cantonese delicacy since the Qing dynasty. According to Chinese medicine because snakes live in damp areas they are good at fighting ‚Äúdampness‚Äù in the body. Symptoms of dampness include feeling heavy but weak in the limbs, loss of appetite, fatigue and dizziness, and eating snake will help kick it out of your body, says Chinese medicine practitioner Dennis Law. A Cure-all? Ask any random grandmother and she‚Äôll tell you snakes are a panacea, a disease fix-it and general pick-me-up. But that‚Äôs not strictly true. Master Mak, a ‚Äúsnake master‚Äù who has been selling snakes at Ser Wong Lam (13 Hillier St., Sheung Wan, 2543-8032) for 60 years, says snake is not a cure-all, but it certainly can help treat rheumatic diseases, weak liver and kidneys, weak bones and, tendons and rhinitis. The snake bile is key ingredient, and it's apparently great for anyone with asthma or a bad cough, or if you simply need a detox. And according to Ser Wong Lam menus, it helps enhance your libido too. One Traditional Chinese Medicine principle is ‚Äúlike nourishes like‚Äù ‚Äì eat chicken feet if you want stronger legs, for example. Similarly, eating snake bile supposedly helps people ‚Äì especially children ‚Äì become more courageous because the Chinese word for ‚Äúcourage‚Äù sounds a lot like ‚Äúbile,‚Äù Of course, you would need to be quite brave to eat the stuff in the first place.

At the time, he reckoned the most pressing issue was funding. China had tens of millions of students learning piano and violin, and thousands competed in order to enrol in conservatories across the country. Thirteen years on, however, Li, the principal conductor of the China National Symphony Orchestra, the country‚Äôs leading classical ensemble, has a gloomier view. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that the country is richer, has more new concert halls and better orchestras. But there are fewer classical music concertgoers,‚Äù says the Beijing-based maestro. ‚ÄúThat may sound ironic, but it‚Äôs the reality. We musicians in China have been working very hard but to little effect. No one cares. It‚Äôs scary.‚Äù Li, who recently toured the US with the orchestra, will lead the Hong Kong Sinfonietta tomorrow in a season finale featuring works by Beethoven and Mozart, including the latter‚Äôs Piano Concerto No 22 featuring pianist Lio Kuok-wai, a native of Macau. The 42-year-old is in a prime position to observe the changes taking place in classical music on the mainland. A graduate of the Central Conservatory of Music of China and the Musikuniversit√§t Wien in Vienna, he was just 22 when he won the all-China conducting competition. ‚ÄúClassical music as we know it today developed [over time] in Europe, from the Renaissance through to the Industrial Revolution. But in China, the economy has risen so rapidly that people find themselves continually trying to adjust to changes in their lives, such as high property prices. So how would they be in the mood for classical music?‚Äù he asks. People are too exhausted for a concert, or seek other forms of entertainment for relaxation Li Xincao, conductor ‚ÄúYoung professionals and college graduates work around the clock to make money, which never seems to be enough to offset the rising cost of living. They are either too exhausted for a concert, or seek other forms of entertainment for relaxation or for excitement. A classical music concert, or an opera, doesn‚Äôt seem appealing. It is something that requires an active, rather than passive, mindset for appreciation.‚Äù Li acknowledges he is in a fortunate position compared to the older generation of conductors, many of whom were sent to remote villages to do physical labour during the Cultural Revolution. ‚ÄúMy predecessors went t"

It's estimated that nearly one-third of U.S. children and teens are now overweight or obese.The findings suggest that waning exercise levels are \"not likely the major explanation of the recent increase in obesity among U.S. adolescents,\" the investigators report in the journal Obesity Reviews.That does not mean, however, that it's fine for teenagers to be sedentary.

Heightened tensions were also reflected in the Legislative Council, as lawmakers from both the pan-democratic and pro-establishment camps tussled over issues like the government's funding proposals for waste treatment facilities and new town development plans. Political analysts have called for all sides to calm down and for the government to adopt a more inclusive approach in the new year. But many doubt that 2015 can be the year of resolution. They forecast instead more fractiousness and a deepening divide, with the debate on political reforms expected to continue taking centre stage, and the city's chronic housing shortage and health care possibly becoming combustible issues that could further polarise society. Government officials, their advisers, academics and residents in general are also expected to continue their search for new formulas to boost the city's economy, as well as focus on finding the right balance between energy consumption and conservation. Overall, what are Hongkongers' expectations for 2015? A recent survey by Hong Kong University gives some clues. Some 43 per cent of more than 1,000 people surveyed last month expected overall conditions in the city to worsen this year, an increase of eight percentage points over what they expected last year, with the net optimism index down by seven percentage points. So it would appear another rollercoaster year is here, and Hongkongers might want to fasten their seatbelts as they welcome 2015. Tony Cheung reports. ¬† 1. Political reform: Elusive hunt for a solution Most commentators and lawmakers the Post spoke to identified political reform as the top item on the agenda this year, yet they remain divided on the way out of the ongoing impasse. The government is expected to launch a second round of public consultation as early as next week, to gauge public opinion on reform details for universal suffrage for the chief executive election due in 2017. However, the pan-democratic camp has vowed to boycott the consultation exercise, in protest against Beijing's ruling in August that the city can only choose from two or three candidates backed by half of a 1,200-strong nominating committee's members. Civic Party leader Alan Leong Kah-kit, who convenes a weekly meeting among 23 pan-democrats to discuss their priorities, said: \"Without a real and democratic election, I really think any other policy could only be dealt with superficially, and [we are] not tackling it at its root.\" To add to the divisive atmosphere, elections are also around the corner for the district councils. More than 400 seats will be up for grabs in the November polls, when the pro-establishment camp, which controls at least half of the seats citywide, will seek to enlarge its base. Pan-democrats will also want to test their electoral muscles ahead of a bigger contest next year: the Legislative Council elections. Tam Yiu-chung, chairman of the city's biggest Beijing-loyalist party the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, also believes political reform will be the hottest topic in town, but his colleague in the pro-establishment camp, Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) lawmaker Wong Kwok-kin, disagrees. \"It will be an important milestone if it can be approved, but we all know how slim that chance is,\" Wong said. He urged the pan-democrats to reconsider their approach. But Leong maintains that his camp is voting against the government's reform package when it is tabled before the summer break in July. This new clash of wills is expected to trigger another round of pro-democracy protests in the city. 2. Housing and land strategy: Th"

Alone in a parking lot outside Arthur Ashe Stadium at about 2am Monday, a handful of hours after beating Roger Federer in the US Open final for his third major title of 2015 and 10th overall, there stood Djokovic, unable to unlock the car he‚Äôd been using to drive himself between the tournament site in Queens and the hotel near Central Park where he stayed with his wife and their 10-month-old son the past two weeks. Turned out, he said, a member of his entourage accidentally grabbed the keys while gathering Djokovic‚Äôs bags.

His chosen metre was the andadi , in which the last word of the stanza is also the first of the next. Nammalvar is said to have lived in the ninth century and, by the time of Tirumangai Alvar, his verses had achieved religious sanction as integral parts of temple ritual.\nHis verse continues to excite devotees and lovers of literature alike for many reasons.

The banks face huge non-performing loans, flimsy capitalisation and declining profits. Their customer base has been weaned on and weakened by policy lending and many are unable to compete in the country's emerging market economy.\nIronically, the good news for the mainland may be the financial typhoon savaging Asia's economies, which has spurred a reluctant Beijing leadership to press ahead with financial sector reforms that it has selectively implemented only since the early 1990s.\nIt was the onset of the turmoil last autumn that provided Zhu Rongji, then vice-premier in charge of economic affairs, with the ammunition to convince colleagues that modernisation of the antiquated banking system needed to become a national priority.\nThat the party and government came together for the first time since 1949 to organise a joint conference last November - attended not just by bankers, but provincial leaders, too - was proof of Beijing's awareness of the weaknesses of its banking sector and the need for a massive and immediate overhaul.\nBy any standard, the mainland's banking sector is saddled with enormous problems. They are:  The system's non-performing loans, as conservatively estimated by Standard & Poor's, amounted to US$200 billion at the end of last year. That represented about 25 per cent of the total loans outstanding, or a quarter of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). It also represented the highest ratio of non-performing loans among all East Asian countries.\nThe country's ratio of M2 - currency in circulation plus all deposits - to GDP stood at 121.7 per cent, which is among the highest in the world, indicating an inefficient use of capital resources.\nChina will need 490 billion yuan, not the 270 billion yuan suggested by the announcement earlier this year of a special treasury-bond issue, to bring the capital adequacy ratio of its four specialised state banks to 6 per cent, the norm for member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. A total of 855 billion yuan will be needed to reach a capital adequacy ratio of 10 per cent, considered reasonable for a developing country.\nAlthough state-sector companies generated only 1.9 per cent of the mainland's US$76.5 billion in corporate profit in the first half of 1997, those firms absorbed about 75 per cent of all bank loans during the period.\nThe Industrial and Co"

But in January last year, he did it literally, chomping and swallowing the glossy paper on which his 'From the Ether' column in US computer trade magazine InfoWorld is printed.\nThe cause for this less-than-tasty meal was his bold predictions throughout 1996 that the Internet would collapse that year, leaving millions unable to read their e-mail or browse the Web.\nAs Mr Metcalfe told it during a stopover in Hong Kong last month, he was almost right.\n'I predicted that the Internet would slow down and break down occasionally' that year, the inventor of Ethernet, the most popular networking standard, said.\nHe points to America Online, whose 6.2 million customers lost service for 19 hours that year, and NetCom, with 400,000 subscribers, which broke down for 13 hours.

Rather than giving each a title, he numbered them. All are set in the bleak housing estates of a Polish suburb. In turn, we see a father and son, a tired elderly medic, an adulterous wife hunting her ex-husband, a murderer, a middle-aged vamp considering one last fling, and a mother and a grandfather scrapping over the child they both adore.\nThere are not many light moments, but there are many insights and observations that are quite unforgettable. Kieslowski used different camera crews but the same editor throughout, to make the films consistent yet different. Dekalog is an ambitious, worthy and remarkable achievement, but I still think only real fanatics are going to be able to sit through 584 minutes without a break.

He pledges to take further steps to sustain the steady growth of foreign trade and hopes that countries around the world strengthen coordination to maintain the basic stability of the international foreign exchange market. Chen recognizes that China's foreign trade is facing severe challenges as the global financial crisis is still spreading and deepening. Weak external demand will last for a relatively long time when the US, euro and Japanese economies are all struggling with recession. Shrinking international market may fuel trade protectionism and trade disputes. Risk of default will increase as the credit crunch has deteriorated in some countries and regions, making it more difficult for importers and distributors to finance their business. China's export dropped in November for the first time in seven years. Chen thinks the slowdown reflects both the impact of the international financial crisis and postponed export by some companies to take the advantage of the latest tax rebate policy which is effective as of Dec. 1. The Ministry of Commerce will adopt more supportive polices, encourage enterprises to tap the emerging "

With the flag of Croatia wrapped around him on Saturday night at the Parc des Princes stadium, he said: 'For Croatia, I feel love.'  Croatia beat Holland 2-1 to take third place in the 16th World Cup and they won because they wanted this victory desperately.\nIn most previous World Cup tournaments, the traditional third-place game has been played because it's there.\nIt is a game for the 'nearly men' who were just one victory away from the World Cup final.\nBut this was not the case with Croatia and they beat the Dutch because they simply wanted it so much more. It is not that Holland did not want to win - and should certainly have taken the game to extra-time - but the utter determination, the dedication came from Croatia.\nThere was understandable pride in the voice of coach Miroslav Blazevic when he stood in front of the world's footballing media and said: 'Now I hope that more people will learn about our small country. This has been so important for us.'  The blazing elation which swept through the Croatian team when the final whistle blew on an entertaining and worthwhile game underlined Croatia's total commitment.\nSuker sealed victory and his place as the tournament's top goal-scorer so far with a superb strike and captain Zvonimir Boban, publicly praised for his dedication by Blazevic, had a commanding game.\nCroatia were not popular winners with the largely French crowd, who whistled with deafening venom every time Slaven Bilic touched the ball. It was Bilic who contributed to the sending-off of Laurent Blanc, who missed this morning's World Cup final as a result.\nBilic was not put off by the ear-splitting assault and kissed and held aloft his bronze medal at the end - a gesture not appreciated by the crowd. Bilic is mentally tough and he played his part in keeping the Dutch at bay in the second half when Croatia adopted a largely 'what we have, we hold' approach.\nAll three goals came in the first half and the second period, barring infrequent breakouts by the central Europeans, saw the Dutch unavailingly try to breach the Croatian rearguard.\nCoach Guus Hiddink was left holding little more than earlier memories when he said: 'I am disappointed because we would have liked to finish officially third.

More to the point, how has he done it throughout a career spanning 36 years and about  80 books? On Writing's combination of memoir and writer's guide offered valuable clues. King was no longer just a writer of best-sellers - he was a smart, thoughtful and utterly deliberate writer of best-sellers. It seemed no accident that On Writing coincided with a palpable upturn in his critical fortunes: Stephen King began to be taken seriously. Either that or the same high-brow editors and academics who once read King covertly on a beach now came out of the closet - a closet doubtless chock-a-block with skeletons. The effect was like a global meeting of Stephen King Anonymous. Hello, I'm a literary critic for The New Yorker, and I love The Shining. Of course, not everyone was so impressed. When King was granted a lifetime achievement award at 2003's National Book Award, Harold Bloom, the influential literary professor at Yale University, called it 'another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life'. Both sides of the debate will take heart from King's new book, Full Dark, No Stars, a collection of four novellas. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, its share of horror and horrors, and each one advances our understanding of that poser: how does he do it? We might begin to address this tricky question by asking another: just what exactly is it that Stephen King does? The short answer is: he scares us stupid. The smart answer is: he scares us cleverly. The long answer is provided by the first story in Full Dark, No Stars: 1922. Set on a remote Nebraskan farm, it traces the slow death of a family through greed, mistrust, fear and - deep breath - rats. Yet, as so often, the basic set-up is strikingly ordinary. It's as if King is whispering in our ear: I know these people seem fictional, but they could be you or me, couldn't they? The main players in 1922 are Wilfred and Arlette James, and their teenage son, Henry. The tension between husband and wife is palpable, but nothing different from what most couples confront on a weekly basis. Wilfred is bookish but masculine: hard-working and taciturn. Arlette is garrulous and flighty,  ambitious and bored of rural life. Tragically as it turns out, she also controls the purse strings: she not only owns the farm, she wants to sell it (to Farrington's hog butchery) and move somewhere fancier, like Omaha or St Louis. It is typical of King's common touch that somewhere fancier is not New York or Los Angeles. The thought so terrifies Wilfred that he tries everything he can think of to stop Arlette: anger, love, manipulation, guilt, emotional blackmail. When he has exhausted everything he can think of, Wilfred's dark imagination kicks in. Torn between the parents is poor, innocent Henry. King isn't especially concerned "

Global audiences love a revolution, especially when it fits neatly into a David and Goliath narrative: Goliath, in this case, is the authoritarian Chinese state, the ineffectual chief executive and her government, and the police, whose excessive use of force was found by Amnesty International to be a violation of international law. The protesters‚Äô objective: oppose the government‚Äôs proposed amendments to a law that would allow any person in Hong Kong to be extradited to and face trial in China, a country whose legal system has been criticised for pervasive human rights abuses and procedural unfairness. They also demanded that the government retract the designation of a previous protest as a ‚Äúriot‚Äù, hold the police accountable for their unreasonable use of force, and enact universal suffrage and democracy. Brian Leung, the only protester to take off his mask, read out these demands in the form of the Admiralty declaration. On 9 July, Carrie Lam announced in a press conference that the extradition bill was ‚Äúdead‚Äù ‚Äì but she has been criticised for failing to invoke a formal legal procedure of withdrawal and to meet the protesters‚Äô other demands. The storming of the legislature is the latest in a series of actions starting from a march in the first week of June attended by 1.3 million people.

No wonder that Glenn Hoddle is thought to be envied by every other coach in the World Cup finals.\nBut wait a minute. Robbie Fowler is underachieving, Les Ferdinand is injured again after missing most of the season, Chris Sutton's pique has probably ruled him out of contention and, at 32, the dip in Ian Wright's performances could be permanent.\nBarring a serious setback in rehabilitation, Shearer is a certainty to lead the line for Hoddle in the World Cup, leaving two, maybe three out of the 19 places to be filled by designated attackers, a category into which Teddy Sheringham falls despite the blurring of function brought about by strategic development.\nThe success of a partnership put in place by Terry Venables for Euro 96 makes Sheringham the favourite to operate in conjunction with Shearer, whose role he could duplicate in emergency.\nIf further proof of maturity leads to Owen's inclusion, as has been suggested by Hoddle after Owen's historic England debut against Chile, World Cup history suggests that only one other place will be available to Hoddle's remaining strikers. The choice could fall possibly on Dion Dublin, who has not only the advantage of being able to fill in at centre-half but also of providing' an aerial threat.\nStrange things can happen.\nIt was unthinkable that England could win the 1966 World Cup without Jimmy Greaves, who was established beyond all reasonable doubt as one of the greatest goalscorers football had ever known.\nBut Greaves failed to regain his place from Geoff Hurst after dropping out through injury and the rest, as they say, is history.\nLess than a month before recording the only hat-trick in a World Cup final, shortly after Greaves put four goals past Norway, it was thought unlikely that Hurst (substitutes were not introduced until 1970) would appear in the tournament.\nStruggling to overcome the difficulties imposed by a barren, bumpy surface, Hurst looked so clumsy when selected for a friendly against Denmark in Copenhagen that Alf Ramsey's judgement was called into question by a member of England's training staff.\n'Not up to it,' was Harold Shepherdson's private word on Hurst as we passed through Copenhagen airport the following morning.\nWith only three strikers in his squad, Ramsey returned to the pairing of Greaves and Roger Hunt for England's final warm- up, their toughest, again"

And the decision to have live broadcasts of racing was considered a contentious decision by the  public broadcaster.

Then there is the political satire programme Headliner, which was  lambasted by veteran pro-Beijing figure Xu Simin as 'weird and [in] bad taste'. More recently, senior RTHK executives have been  criticised by a judge for 'turning a blind eye' to abuses in tendering for production contracts. The criticism followed the conviction of a former staff member and two accomplices for conspiring to defraud RTHK of $740,000 by submitting false bids for production contracts. It was one of a handful of cases of illegal practices in the operation and management of RTHK that have come to light in the past few years.

In fact, China will automatically obtain full market economy status anyway 15 years after joining the World Trade Organization, according to the rules of the WTO. However, an early recognition of China's market economy status would be a sign of friendship and goodwill, said Gu Qingyang, director of public management and training at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore. It is a pragmatic choice and in the interests of ASEAN countries to recognize China's market economy status before the deadline. Zhuang Juzhong, deputy chief economist at the Asian Development Bank, also said that ASEAN countries hope more countries can recognize China as a market economy because overall it will be a win-win situation. EU uses non-recognition as excuse to restrict Chinese productsExperts have said that the European Union and its member states refuse to grant China market economy status not because they fail to see China's economic achievements and development trends but because they want to use non-recognition as an excuse to impose strict restrictions on Chinese products.

Paton Walsh says it was 'completely obvious' who was the intended victim - as, indeed, it is now to the reader almost from the outset - and a page from Sayers' correspondence made it clear who she intended the killer to be.\nBut Paton Walsh said she was still left with a choice: 'Am I trying to write a jolly good modern book just using these chapters, or am I trying to write her book?  'Technically I had a choice, because the trustees [of Sayers' estate] had given me a free hand.\n'But I also thought there was no interest in the project unless I tried to complete it as her book . . . [and] I thought writing her book was more interesting.'  Yet she believed mimicry would not be sufficient if she were to accept the trustees' offer and complete what would have been Sayers' 12th Wimsey novel.\n'It was a very high-risk project for both of us.\n'If it does not work it does not do her any credit and it would certainly not do me any credit either, but that was what I found so interesting,' Paton Walsh says.\n'I hoped I would be able to fuse with her, become her voice. But the difficulty is, can you say something in her voice that she did not say?'  In the case of Paton Walsh, an acclaimed novelist shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1994, the answer is a resounding yes.\nPublication of Thrones, Dominations (Hodder and Stoughton) has critics and readers alike turning cross-eyed in their efforts to work out which parts were written by Paton Walsh and which by Sayers.\nPaton Walsh will not say, because 'it would spoil the fun', and she does not want readers skipping through and comparing. 'Either this project is a failure or people should read the whole book.' She says the end result is about one-fifth Sayers, predominantly at the beginning, but not with Sayers' chapter divisions.\nPaton Walsh also added some suspects because she believed there were too few.\nCrime queen P D James, who turned down the job and told Paton Walsh she had done so because of the weight of surviving material by and about Sayers, has now cause for a rethink.\n'She is kind enough to say I have proved her wrong,' Paton Walsh says.\nThrones, Dominations has also been endorsed by the Dorothy L Sayers Society and by Dr Barbara Reynolds, Sayers' "

As most people know, the internet is basically a bunch of connected computers. Surfing the web is all about accessing files on those computers. What most people don't know is that when you connect to the internet, you are not a passive viewer - you become part of the web and your computer is as accessible as any other. Dial-up connections are fairly safe for a few reasons. Every computer on the internet has an address that distinguishes it from every other computer on the internet. When you have a dial-up connection, that address changes every time you connect, making it more difficult for a hacker to find your computer.

The answer of course is: 'Far too much to leave time for any proper hobbies like chasing around after a ball in all sorts of weather, or running about in shorts and expensive footwear.'  Not that I would bother anyway. Outdoor pursuits have never really appealed, so I must say the new series How To Outdoor (Pearl, 6.20pm) has not caused me any great excitement. Putting aside my personal prejudices, I must point out that there is a nice twist to this show.\nIt is like a kind of sporting version of Through The Keyhole, in which a celeb, or even sometimes just an otherwise ordinary man or woman, gets the chance to reveal to Chip, the show's presenter, a secret passion for their own favourite sport.\nTonight, for example"

Oracle chief security officer Mary Ann Davidson said last week that it was time to rid the software industry of a culture of insecurity that directly affected the cost of doing business. One of the apparent, albeit unstated, causes of the problem was Microsoft. Oracle competes against the software giant in the database, business application and collaboration software markets. 'The stakes have never been higher for information security, and especially information assurance, the degree of confidence that customers can have in the security claims of a vendor,' said Ms Davidson, who was on the first leg of a two-week Asian tour of selected markets. She said the state of software security remained fragile as computer security breaches and Internet attacks continued. 'The SQL Slammer worm may or may not prove to be as costly as the Code Red or LoveLetter viruses, but it was surprisingly swift and remarkably nimble,' she said.

So the warm greetings of the locals are mainly in Japanese and Korean.This may well change in 2012, when Lombok will have its own international airport.Compared to Bali, the beaches here are less populated, but the water is equally clean and the sun, just as bright.Diving shops are everywhere. They are the most common sight, after Internet cafes and restaurants.One of the must-do activities on the island is, of course, diving. The Gili Islands lying in the sparkling ocean just off the northwest coast of Lombok is a clear favorite.Gili comprises three perfect coral islands. Fringed by white sands and swaying palm trees, they are a much sought-after diving paradise. Each of the three islands has its unique personality, and appeals to different groups of holidaymakers.Gili Air is the closest to the mainland and the most densely populated. It abounds in diving facilities and you can go snorkeling right from the shore, particularly from beaches on the east and northeast. The south of the island offers some good surfing.Gili Trawangan is the largest island and furthest from the mainland, but can easily be reached in less than 1 hour by slow boat, or 10 minutes by speedboat. It is the most developed of the three islands, offering a variety of accommodation, bars and restaurants.It is one of the best diving spots in Lombok. Snorkeling is extremely easy just off the shore, with vast gardens of blue coral and abundant tropical fish to enjoy.Snorkeling for a day costs $30, that includes the boat and instructor fee. To"

While the ongoing change is not designed to create new agencies, it is a key stage in the process of forging a new financial oversight system that values control and risk prevention over development and deregulation.

Besides the apparent fact that it is much harder for your crop to get found by the Customs and Excise Department ‚Äì Helicopter Division, it is also easier for you to control the ambient conditions. But be aware that herbs grown indoors will not appear the same as their outdoor cousins. They will be scrawnier and have weaker stems but despite their measly appearance they will produce as much, if not more, herb resin. Which means you‚Äôll also get more friends. Genetics First things first, get seeds. If you‚Äôve been cooking with good-looking herbs recently, then save those seeds. The seeds should be virile -  not gray and shriveled, but plump and green. A good test to see if your seeds will grow is to drop one onto a hot frying pan; if it cracks loudly then that batch is good for planting. Lighting If you paid attention in biology class, you‚Äôll know that plants grow through photosynthesis. In other words, you need a light cycle. At least eight hours of light a day must be provided. As you increase the light, the plants grow faster and more females than male plants develop. Sixteen hours of light per day seems to be the optimum amount, but don‚Äôt overdo it - 24 hours will hurt your precious new plants. They need rest as much as light. Just like you, after a particularly pleasant evening snacking on herbal brownies. High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps are the best option for most indoor growers. They usually come in three different kinds: High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Metal Halide (MH) and Mercury Vapor. Renowned for their ability to significantly increase the size and potency of your plants, an HID is one small investment worth making. If possible, use the Son Agro, which is a high quality type of HPS. One indoor grower we spoke to said, ‚ÄúNot only do the plants grow quickly under the bulb, but the results are usually leafy and compact. Although they do not last as long as normal HPS bulbs, that‚Äôs a sacrifice you have to be willing to make.‚Äù It is difficult to find these lamps at the retail level in Hong Kong, but you can order them via several websites: DIY Trade: www.diytrade.com; and Busy Trade: busytrade.com. Vegetation\/Flowering There are two stages in the successful growth of most plants and herbs- vegetation and flowering. Home gardeners need to create a separate area for each process. During the period of vegetation, blue spectrum light a"

Tony Britton, who is in Hong Kong this week starring in the play Bedroom Farce at the Conrad hotel, is a much loved performer who was most recently on SAR screens in The Day of the Jackal, playing a bemused but hard-working British police chief.\nHis major characteristic, in long-running shows such as Robin's Nest and Don't Wait Up, was an intelligent irritability at finding himself in absurd situations, or forced to deal with people who simply would not behave as expected.\nToday, in real life, in his early 70s and at the end of a two-month tour that has taken in at least six other cities before reaching Hong Kong, he exudes the intelligence without a trace of the irritability.\nIn fact, he is almost reluctant to talk about himself, not something one expects in an actor. 'I must stop,' he says suddenly in the middle of one tale. 'I must stop blowing my own trumpet.'  He is happier talking sincerely about the talents of his fellow cast members again - not a common practice among actors, except in a meaningless, hyperbolic fashion that usually suggests they mean the opposite of what they are saying.\nBedroom Farce does require good acting to make it work. Like most of the other works by its author, the leading British writer of comedy for theatre, Alan Ayckbourn, the plot turns not just on unexpected problems, but extremely funny, and utterly believable relationships between people.\nBritton plays the husband in one of four couples"

He decided to raise his right arm 90 degrees in the air - and 25 years on it's still up there.\nThe fingers have long since withered through misuse into the palm of his hand and his knuckles are white with rot, while his nails have grown long, gnarled and twisted.\nSpeaking through clouds of hash that Batr and his followers puff through a wooden chillum, he admits that the formative years of arm raising were not easy. 'It was very painful keeping my arm up there at first,' he says. 'These days, though, it's no problem.'  He chokes on a freshly made hashish pipe and passes it on. Meanwhile, well dressed pilgrims deferentially kneel in front of him as he blesses them with wood ash, which he then smears over his naked body.\nBatr's life, however, has not always been centred around arm raising, nudity and drug taking. He was once a shipping agent running a company in Delhi, living a normal life with a wife and children.\nHe had what he says was either a spiritual revelation or a nervous breakdown 35 years ago.\nHe left work and took off for the Himalayas. He never returned. In fact he never even went home to say goodbye to his family and he's never seen or heard from them ever since.\n'I must never see them again, my old life is dead. If they ever try to see me I would have to tell people to send them away,' he says with a hint of remorse.\nFor the past three decades Batr has lived life as an ascetic Hindu monk, more commonly known as a Sadhu, in India. Once committed there's no turning back and there's certainly no way home.\nSadhus are already dead and their remaining years are whimsical irrelevancies, they say.\nThe plains of northern India are sacred to Hindus.

While Group of Eight (G8) leaders meeting in Birmingham, England, are unlikely to offer much to address the immediate symptoms, they are at least poised to put in place long-term measures aimed at ensuring the ills of the kind that gave rise to crisis in Asia are never again allowed to go undetected.\nWork on the question of promoting greater stability in international financial markets had already begun after the previous G8 meeting in Denver. But with the outbreak of Asia's problems, efforts to find answers suddenly became more urgent.\nOver the next three days, the fruits of that search are set to be crystalised into a blueprint for radical change in the global financial architecture.\nUp for debate is a five-point plan, dubbed the Birmingham Process.\nThis aims at tackling problems of transparency and data dissemination, integrating countries into the global economy, strengthening national financial systems, reducing the 'moral hazards' of private-sector lending, and enhancing the policing role of international institutions.\n'These will be the major lessons that we will put to the heads of government when they meet at Birmingham,' according to Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, who has spearheaded the drive to implement radical change in the global financial architecture.\nIncreasing transparency was relevant to all countries, and "

President Jiang Zemin will deliver a keynote speech on 'Beida spirit' in the Great Hall of the People tomorrow, and all other Politburo Standing Committee members will attend.\nThe move is seen as a reconciliatory gesture towards the university, once listed as a 'heavy disaster' region after the June 4 student movement.\nMr Jiang is also prepared to use the occasion to preach his latest slogans of 'reviving the nation through science and education', as well as 'patriotism'.\nIn his inscription dedicated to Beida last week, Mr Jiang put 'patriotism and progressiveness' ahead of 'science and democracy', the university's traditional spirit.\n'Beida has always been patriotic, this can be proved by its launching of anti-Russian expansionism and anti-Japanese invasion movements in 1903 and 1935,' Tian Xiaolin, chairman of the Beida Alumni Association in Hong Kong, said.\n'To have democratic ideas and be capable of independent thinking is not confrontational.'  At least 50,000 alumni from China and overseas will gather for the festivities, along with 60 presidents of leading universities, including Harvard and Oxford.\nDespite the high-profile celebrations, some professors were worried the Government"

This week, Japan Inc is still in business and under no obvious threat except that of the country's inexorable economic and political decline to third-world status. The findings shatter the myth of Japan as a modern, efficient industrial democracy and paint a picture of a cosy, corrupt club of old boys running the country for their own benefit. 'The Tepco [Tokyo Electric Power Company] Fukushima nuclear power plant accident was the result of collusion between the government, the regulators and Tepco, and the lack of governance by said parties,' the parliamentary inquiry concluded. Collusion between the unholy trio meant that they had all 'betrayed the nation's right to safety from nuclear accidents'. Tepco 'manipulated its cosy relationship with regulators to take the teeth out of regulations', the report said after more than 900 hours of hearings and interviews with 1,167 people. Its chairman, Kiyoshi Kurokawa, a medical doctor and university professor, lamented in his introduction: 'What must be admitted, very painfully, is that this was a disaster 'Made in Japan'. Its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to 'sticking with the programme'; our groupism; and our insularity.'

The analysts say that Moscow's mistrust of Beijing has deepened because of China's rapid economic development and military advances, even though Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated that the development of ties with China would be a priority because of Russia's own economic needs and aversion to the West. On the sidelines of last week's Shanghai Co-operation Organisation summit, Putin declared that no international issues could be resolved without the participation of Beijing and Moscow. Putin and his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, also said in a statement following their bilateral talks that they opposed the use of threats and the imposition of unilateral sanctions against Iran. On Syria, the two countries said they supported the efforts of the United Nations' special envoy to Syria, Kofi Annan, while opposing a forced change in the Syrian government by the UN.

Africa doesn't choke this time\nMarch 13, 2011 00:00 IST\nIndia fails to capitalise on the start provided by openers\nOn a day of fortune swings, Sachin Tendulkar conjured up a century and Dale Steyn sent down an inspired spell. And a lesser name, Robin Peterson, emerged the hero in an explosive climax.\nPursuing 297, South Africa required 13 runs from the final over bowled by left-arm seamer Ashish Nehra. South Africa did not choke on this occasion.\nPeterson edged a swipe to the boundary, dismissed the paceman beyond the mid-wicket ropes, collected a brace and then forced the bowler through covers to nail a sensational three-wicket win for his side in the Group B World Cup match at the Vidarbha Cricket Association ground here on Saturday.\nZaheer Khan had sent down an exceptional 49th over of control ‚Äî he conceded only four runs. Peterson and Francois du Plessis, who displayed a calm head under pressure, had the last laugh.\nTurning point\nThe turning point of the match arrived much earlier when India, mismanaging its batting Power Play, collapsed from 267 for one to 296 all out in a span of 54 deliveries. Man-of-the-Match Steyn, mixing his pace and length and unleashing telling yorkers, picked up five wickets.\nThen, A.B. de Villiers came up with a blinder under pressure in the chase. Light on his feet, he was able to convert the length. South Africa came back from the brink.\nThe batting Power Play, from the 37th to the 41st overs, yielded South Africa a whopping 52 runs for the loss of a wicket. The side was back in the hunt.\nThe Indian bowling wilted under pressure conceding 99 runs in the last 11 overs. And the fielding, save on a couple of exceptions, was below international standards.\nYet, India called the shots at the start. With the surface becoming a tad slow, momentum eluded South African openers Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla.\nThe left-handed Smith never appeared comfortable before falling to his nemesis Zaheer Khan as the opener miscued a drive to mid-off.\nAsking rate climbs\nAs the ball got softer, finding boundaries became harder. Not quite middling the ball, Amla (61) and Kallis (69) were largely restric"

(Photo\/Xinhua)\nHigh school's intense training program yields many high-score students, but stifles creativity, report Hou Liqiang and Zhang Yu in Hengshui, Hebei province\nIt's make-or-break time for millions of high school students in China.\nSaturday morning signals the start of two days of grueling activity, both mental and physical, as students take the national university entrance exam known as gaokao. Because success in the exam can open the door to a well-paid job and high social standing, the pressure on the students can be overwhelming.\nHowever, few students are as committed, or prepared for gaokao success, as those at Hengshui High School in Hebei province, which has gained fame - and some criticism - for its tough regime and impressive success rate.\nFor senior students, the day begins at 5:30 am and lasts until 10:10 pm, with every hour punctuated by the incessant ringing of bells that announce classes, break times, self-study periods, extracurricular activities and dormitory time.\nThe students spend most of their time in cramped classrooms. Although the designated food breaks last 40 minutes, many students rush to the canteen and wolf down their food in less than five minutes so they can snatch an extra few minutes for their studies.\nSun Yajian, a freshman at Shanghai International Studies University, who graduated from Hengshui High last year, said he even ran t"

The OECD's estimates are the most pessimistic so far by any official institution, and appear to be even more bearish than the predictions of most private sector economists.\nIt seems that only Lehman Brothers, which has forecast 0.5 per cent growth, and JP Morgan, which sees a 0.6 per cent contraction, come close to the OECD estimate of 0.9 per cent growth in Hong Kong's 1998 real gross domestic product.\nWhat the IMF has to say about Hong Kong will be of interest. How its predictions compare with the OECD's estimates will undoubtedly be a talking point, but whether its forecasts will be remembered by the end of the week is questionable.\nOn the day the OECD produced its Hong Kong growth estimates, Exchange Square simply ignored them, and the Hang Seng Index ended about 28 points higher. In the money markets, US$\/HK$ forwards ended flat.\nThe IMF study is expected to have a similar absence of impact, whatever it says about Hong Kong.\nPaine Webber chief economist Alison Cottrell said: 'These reports don't usually have a major impact.

'I am extremely thrilled by the policies which will create an additional and exciting dimension of legal practice for Hong Kong lawyers,' said Anthony Chow Wing-kin, the leader of a Law Society delegation which had just returned from Beijing. Major reforms announced by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) in July that year appeared to have opened up the potential goldmine of the mainland market as China prepared to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Hong Kong lawyers, it was revealed, would be allowed to take exams in Chinese law to enable them to practise on the mainland. They would also be allowed to be employed by mainland firms and form partnerships with them.. But a very different picture is now emerging, and ironically, part of the problem appears to have been caused by China's WTO entry in December. Apparently under pressure from other WTO states, the mainland authorities have backed away from granting preferential treatment to Hong Kong, a separate WTO entity. SAR lawyers are still banned from taking the qualifying exams and forbidden to accept jobs with mainland firms. And when new rules are announced, perhaps later this month, they are expected to be little different from those applying to lawyers from overseas. Bar Association chairman Alan Leong Kah-kit, SC, said he understood pressure from other WTO countries had caused the change of heart. 'Immense pressure was brought to bear by other WTO countries asking why they were doing this for HK lawyers. That, as I understand it, forced the MOJ to rethink what it had said,' he said. 'It is disappointing. I can understand why it has happened, but I really think there is no justification.' Contact with mainland lawyers suggested they were very keen to link up with their Hong Kong counterparts, said Mr Leong. 'They grumble that the MOJ is not seeing things the same way.' He argued there was a strong case for allowing lawyers on either side of the border to work together. 'The MOJ has to be less obstructive in preventing the teaming up of Hong Kong lawyers with their mainland counterparts. It is a win-win situation in the long run,' Mr Leong said. Alan Hoo, SC, a member of a high-level legal think-tank on the impact of China's WTO entry, said the situation posed constit"

Why did he turn so much against the imperialist army? Maybe it was what he saw there. Because he was among the leaders (of the Easter Rising, an insurrection staged by Irish republicans against British rule in Ireland), he was executed by the British at Kilmainham Gaol (in Dublin), in 1916. I saw her crying once, that would have been in the early 1920s. My sister and I were playing, and I went to the kitchen and my mother was standing at the window. I can be very clear about the day - it was a fine, May day. And I've often thought since: was it May 8th? That was the anniversary of when he was executed. I walked away, told my sister and we both kept quiet. TO THE GAOL My father had sent for me in prison and I was brought to Kilmainham, but I was only two. I've no memory of it.

We cannot get a meaningful figure on the total production of an economy by simply adding up all the sales figures. If we did there would be a lot of double counting.\nFor example, the sales figures of garment factories include the value of cloth which would duplicate the sales values of the weaving factories.\nTo eliminate double counting, GDP is derived by summing up only the value of goods and services that a goods-producer or service-producer has ad"

On the political front, Tung Chee-hwa since taking office has tried to maintain an almost neutral stance towards any political direction, in order to keep the status quo of being acquiescent towards Beijing. As for economic policy, Donald Tsang has to be congratulated for saving the Hang Seng Index from total meltdown, but the macro economic planning that Hong Kong desperately needs to secure its future has not materialised. In short, Hong Kong is now at a crucial turning point in its history. It can go in two possible directions. One possible di"
